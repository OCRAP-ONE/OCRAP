review/summary: Not as good as the buds (40% fiber vs. 51%).
review/text: After trying the Bran Buds version of this cereal, I thought I would give these a try.  While a little lower in fiber from the buds, I think this cereal falls short when compared to the buds in another way:  sogginess in milk.<br /><br />With the buds, they could sit in milk for minutes without ballooning up and turning to mush.  These fine strips of bran however, turn to mush within a minute of sitting in milk.  Seriously, the crunch is gone in no time and thereby making it harder for me to get down.<br /><br />I'll finish off the pack and return to the buds and get my 11% more fiber and a few more minutes to eat them before they get mushy.

review/summary: The elusive Bran Flakes
review/text: I am delighted with my purchase. It used to be one could buy Kellogg's Bran Flakes in any grocery story, but for some unknown reason they were discontinued first at my Super Fresh in Havertown, PA, then at Shaws in Colchester, VT (where I shop on weekends with my husband), then at Genuardi's in Wynnewood, PA, and as far as I can tell any of the grocery stores near me in either PA or VT. I did find them at Ralph's in Los Angeles while I was visiting my son there in July. When I told my son about my Bran Flakes problem, and how I didn't like any of the store brands, he suggested I try ordering them from Amazon, from which he seems to buy everything. So, I was delighted to be able to order 8 boxes and have them delivered to Vermont. I now carry a box from my stash to PA when I run out there and am able to happily breakfast at both locations. So, I hope Amazon continues to sell them.

review/summary: "Regular" shipments of Bran Flakes
review/text: I ordered Kellogs Bran Flakes on Subscribe & Save as the price in the supermarket was exhorbitant.  Price on Subscribe & Save wasn't ideal either, but was still sufficiently less than the price in the supermarket to warrant a subscription order.  Each order was for six 500g boxes of Bran Flakes.  I was disappointed with the amount of packaging, as within the Amazon box, each pair of Bran Flake boxes was wrapped in shrink-wrap.  However, the product itself was perfect.  I'm disappointed that it is now no longer available on Subscribe & Save

review/summary: Unacceptable ingredients
review/text: I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.

review/summary: cooking, haircare, skincare and more!
review/text: Our family avoids chemicals as much as possible, so we use coconut oil for cooking, haircare, skincare and more!<br /><br />We use coconut oil as a moisturizer in place of skin lotion (add a couple drops of a good quality essential oil!) We use coconut oil to saute or steam saute foods; I use a spoonful of coconut oil in our stainless steel cookware so foods NEVER stick! We also use it in our microwave popcorn popper with sea salt for the healthiest, tastiest popcorn around!<br /><br />Coconut is a solid at cooler temperatures, it will turn to liquid when warmed "slightly" to the mid 70s.  Hence I store this bottle above our stove / microwave so it's usually a liquid. To make it MUCH easier to use, I have a wide mouth glass jar that I keep refilled.  When the jar turns solid I can still scoop the oil paste out with a spoon.

review/summary: BAD Smell, WORSE Packaging, not virgin
review/text: I've been buying other brands of coconut oil from Amazon such as Nature's Way and Nutiva. Those are good brands. I ran out and I saw this brand at my grocery store so I bought it. First of all, the packaging... it comes in bottle that is just like a shampoo bottle, cheap plastic and not at all appetizing... and then the most ridiculous thing of all is the teeny tiny spout for dispensing the product--coconut oil is a SOLID at room temperature! How are you supposed to dispense a SOLID out of this teeny spout!?!<br /><br />I had to do as others did, I warmed the bottle until the oil melted and I poured it all into another more practical container, a jar. But immediately the oil smells BAD, it has a burnt smell. And unlike the pure white virgin coconut oils from the other suppliers I mentioned, this has a brown tint and some brown gunk that settles to the bottom of the jar. Yuck! This oil is NOT extra virgin, or even virgin coconut oil like the others. It seems very cheap and impure. For all I know they used solvents to extract it. It's very suspect.<br /><br />I used it for cooking until I could buy a better brand. It's OK for on your skin, but that's about it. I will never buy this again.

review/summary: Life Changing!
review/text: I bought this to use on my hair, because I had heard it does wonders and it was only about $7, so why not try it? My hair is curly, and naturally dry and delicate. I've dyed and flat ironed it too many times, so it was pretty damaged and breaking off. I'm getting married in 8 months and really wanted to get my hair healthy again!<br /><br />I have used this as a deep conditioner, by wetting my hair and applying a liberal amount of the oil all over my head, concentrating on the ends. I then put on a plastic shower cap and let it sit for at least 2 hours. When you shampoo, make sure you use a clarifying shampoo and wash it at least twice to get all the oil out. It leaves my hair so silky and hydrated! And it's not like some deep conditioners out there that only give you results the first day and after that your hair is dry again--this stuff really works!<br /><br />I also use it as a leave in conditioner in my hair, especially when I'm wearing my hair curly (I let it air dry). I have also used it as a styling product (for shine or pomade) and plus it conditions your hair all day. Works great! My hair is so infinitely healthier in only a month!<br /><br />The oil is kind of a solid, but as long as you keep it in a warm room you're fine. Rub it between your hands for about 2 seconds and it is liquid again. Not a problem at all. It smells great, kind of nutty, I love it. Best "hair" product I have ever found, and I've tried many.

review/summary: Great quality and price
review/text: This is excellent quality pure coconut oil at an incredibly good price! It works very well used in lieu of damaging, petroleum based anti-chapping agents. When cold it will harden but can easily be returned to its liquid state by inserting the bottle under hot water(it does work equally well in its hardened form.) We transfer a portion to a small container and carry it with us in lieu of petroleum "sticks" when we hike, climb or ski. It goes on smoothly without a greasy feel and more importantly, does not block healthy lip tissue regeneration. It also tastes and smells good.  We were very pleased with the manner in which the seller communicated with us to assure that our transaction went smoothly. This seller and his product rate an A+ in our book!

This seems to be the only brand that India makes. It's not organic or extra virgin but I wanted to try it anyways. It is tan in color not like organic coconut oil and it smells like used grease from a frying pan. It smells that way too. I will not purchase this again.

My only concern is the bottle expires 15 months from the date of manufacturer date, so this bottle is good for another month.<br />I'm glad it was  a small bottle.

review/summary: it smells so bad I could not use this + THIS OIL IS NOT EVEN A BARGAIN!
review/text: I ignored the other reviews for this oil, and purchased because I thought the price was good.  There were two things wrong. First, you will notice it says to put in hot water to melt the oil so you can get it out of the bottle.  This packaging is appropriate for warm weather locations.  Seattle is not a location that works for this product.  2.  The smell gagged me.  You do not want to put this product in your mouth.  I might use this on my hair, before washing it, but that is about it.  It stinks!  I have purchased other brands, from this website and from vitamin websites and they were cheap and lovely to the nose, mouth, and body.  I honestly do not know why this smells so bad. I have edited my review.  The reason I purchased this oil over others was that I thought that it was a bargain.  When I got the container I found that it was no cheaper and in fact more money than some oils I have been purchasing.  If you are using coconut oil for eating or putting on your body,  I urge you not to buy this oil.  It stinks really really bad, is no bargain and you cannot get it out of the container.  I should have returned it to amazon immediately upon receiving this.

review/summary: Solid mass of Coconut Love
review/text: Coconut Oil, as I found out, remains a solid when it is not in its native tropical environment (70+ degrees or so). I also found out that this oil is rather less expensive at international foods section of the local supermarket. This means a) it must be melted to be used, and b) you could save a few bucks by shopping around. However, for the convenience factor, getting it sent to the house was a plus; I used it to make no bake cookies (it added a nutty flavor) and plan to also use it in making chocolate covered pretzels and raisins. No complaints about flavor.

review/summary: Great natural product with Multi Beauty, health and wellness purposes!
review/text: I only give it a 4 because at times there is difficulty extracting the product from the small opening at times, but its perfectly suitable when the bottle is warmed by the surrounding temperature.<br /><br />I actually brought this particular product back with me from when I traveled around India.  It was the natural home moisturizer and beauty treatment there.  Ask any Indian woman how she has such long, strong beautiful hair and she'll tell you its because she conditions her hair and massages her scalp with coconut oil.  I'm not Indian but I'm a girl who has been trying to maintain long hair and suffering from split ends, but reluctant to trim too much and I admired the healthy state of their hair.<br /><br />Its a great moisturizer and also its healthy for you if you want to cook with, its very good for digestion and provides healthy saturated fats.  I know it sounds counter intuitive, but certainly do your own research and don't go against doctors orders.<br /><br />Don't go overboard with consumption or cooking with it, but I was informed having a tablespoon with each meal is beneficial, just be careful not to consume after your meal if you want weight loss.<br /><br />I personally use coconut as a hair conditioner, moisturizer, in place of butter and cooking oil.<br />I use Parachute for only beauty/moisturizing reasons because I find that the opening does not make it easy to extract the oil for cooking because half the year the temperature makes the oils solid and the opening is for the oil in a more liquid state.<br /><br />The coconut oil solidifies when the surrounding temperature is cooler.  This particular bottle makes it difficult to squeeze out if the temperature is too low.  I'd recommend placing the closed bottle it in a bowl of warm to hot water to help melt it a bit.<br /><br />This product is very inexpensive.  Avoid other products that are not 100% pure coconut oil.

I have tried other oils.  Even Nutiva organic oil and I didn't like that oil at all.  It lacked the deep coconut taste I like and also the rich coconut smell.  I had to go back to Parachute and I will not buy anything else but Parachute from now on.  To scared to try anything else out of fear I might get a product like that organic stuff I brought. If you truly have a love for coconut and know how to appreciate the true "taste" and "smell" of coconut then you will appreciate and "love" Parachute.  Parachute is better than Nutiva hands down!!<br /><br />Now I am going to use it for coconut popcorn also.

review/summary: Kinda iffy about this.
review/text: When I ordered from Amazon- I thought I was getting the container pictured... but I got a short, squat version, which was okay... then I tried to use the oil as a "lotion" for my hyper (skin) sensitive newborn daughter- maybe I don't know how coconut oil is? If it's ALWAYS "frozen" and you have to warm it to apply... nonetheless, when I tried to use the spout with the container it came in, it was a MESS. It got ALL over the container, and all over my hands. Complete mess! I was very upset with the construction of the bottle- it simple doesn't work. I have to open the lid and just pour it without the "easy pour" lid. All in all, I do like the oil inside the container!

review/summary: Oaracgyte 100% Coconut Oil
review/text: Comes in a blue plastic bottle which at first seems ok.  However, if you leave it standing in a cold room the oil solidifies in the bottle and won't come out. So I had to put it under hot water to get it liquify.  The quality is good, it tastes great, and can be used as a lubricant or eaten.  I am moving the contents to a glass jar that has a wide opening so I don't have to deal with squeezing it out of this plastic bottle.  Good product.

review/summary: nice light oil
review/text: The product was shipped to me quickly. And yes it did arrive in a solid form but after doing a little research, I knew this was normal and I am pretty used to heating it up in a bowl of warm water before using. My hair is in a transition from relaxed to natural state so I use this product to "seal" moisture in my hair every couple of days. Honestly because of the point I am at with my transition, I can't really say if the product is helping me but I know it hasn't definitely not done any harm to my hair!!! I didn't give the product 5 stars because while the product says 100% pure coconut oil there isn't an ingredient list for me to be sure. And I don't like the smell but it is not a bad smell, just not to my liking. I would say this is a good buy even if it does not work on your hair...it will probably be a nice moisturizer for your skin.

Please know that it will be hard to get out if cold.  I usually hold the bottle between my thighs when I brush my daughter's hair then my body heat makes it softer and I can pour it into my hands and into her hair.

review/summary: Great Hair Product
review/text: This bottle was my second purchase of coconut oil for my natural 4c hair. It (coconut oil, in general) doesn't do much in the way of moisture for my hair, but it's a great sealant. It also moisturizes better when combined with other oils. I loved this particular brand over the other one because it smells so delicious. I used it on my hair, skin, and lips when I ran out of chapstick.<br />The only downside to my purchase was that the seam at the bottom of the bottle burst when the coconut oil hardened from the cold. That wasn't a huge issue, though. I just ran the bottle upside down under some warm water and moved the liquid coconut oil to another container.

review/summary: Great for detangling and deep conditioning!
review/text: I use Parachute Coconut Oil as a pre-shampoo detangler/deep conditioner for my kinky coily, Afro-textured hair. I purchased a 16 oz jar for $5 at a local Indian grocery store.<br /><br />Parachute Coconut Oil has a thick, creamy, lush, velvety texture when solid, It has more slip for finger-detangling than the brands of organic coconut oil I've tried (Nutiva, Vitamin Shoppe, Emerald Laboratories, Trader Joe's). It smells slightly of roasted coconut but that's fine because I top off the coconut oil with a layer of natural conditioner.<br /><br />From now on, I'll use Parachute Coconut Oil for hair and organic coconut oil for skin (via my DIY Body Butter).

review/text: I factually ordered this in to mix with neem oil for my son's acne. Didn't realize it was also edible. lol!  Works great with the neem to take out the stink.  I've been looking for natural handlings for his acne and these are working for him.<br /><br />Anyhow, I used it to whip up some scrambled eggs; delicious! I will use this for other cooking!!!<br /><br />I also somehow acquired a spider bite on my forehead and I heard coconut oil is good for that so I put a little on that and voila, the pain was gone and it shrunk down and disappeared faster than I have ever had a spider bite disappear.  Tried it on a mosquito bite too.  Took the itch away (I get quite the reaction from mosquito bites) and the swelling disappeared, as did the mosquito bite by the next day.<br /><br />Quite happy with the product.<br /><br />Seriously, if you are looking for cocnut oil to cook with, this is it.  Tastes great and is, apparently from what I have read and heard, much better than using animal product or plant based (canola, soybean) oil (GMO).

review/summary: I smell like a girlscout cookie!
review/text: I bought this product to use an as alternative to lotions (I have pretty bad eczema) So far it's working well, and it smells like Samoa girl scout cookies (It smells MUCH better on your skin than it does straight out of the jar, so don't get turned off by the smell until it's on you).<br /><br />It hardens at room temperature, so be prepared to soak the bottle in hot water for a few minutes to get it out. I poured some into a little mason jar for easy access, Now I'll just use it like one of those lotion bars.<br /><br />Recently read that you can even use coconut oil as a deodorant. I don't really need an antiperspirant So I'm going to try this as a deodorant and see how I like it.<br /><br />Great product, will definitely purchase again for skin care.

review/text: Like everyone else, when my coconut oil arrived it was completely solid. But that's how it's supposed to be--it is only in liquid form when it's warm. I actually left mine right on top of a heat vent for a couple of minutes to get it to liquify. If it were summer, I would simply leave it outside for a while.<br /><br />Problem solved.<br /><br />This is a great product for a great price, and I used it as an ingredient in homemade lip balm.

A little bit goes a very long way, and it is wonderful for massages or for relieving dry skin.

review/text: If you're looking for a quality cold-pressed coconut oil, this is NOT the one!!! Stay away! When I first opened it, it looked fine and smelled nice and 'coconutty'. Upon melting it to pour into another container, I was appalled at the nasty bacon grease smell and the yellow color. This is a heat-processed oil, likely using poor quality coconut. I will never ever buy this brand again.

She especially enjoys successfully removing them from the 'Kong' toy it fits into; something I started using as a way to entertain her and provide more of a reward for the effort required to remove it from the toy. She is accustomed to this routine and promptly goes back to bed as this is done early in the morning when I usually get up. I especially like the economical single-wrapped 75 packs so I don't have to put them in another airtight container.

review/summary: Great Taste, Smooth Texture, and Even I Can Do It Right
review/text: Since I travel for my business, and Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast, I have tasted Hollandaise Sauce from many places all across North America - from Georgia to Alaska and Newfoundland to Northwest Territories.<br /><br />I suspect that much (maybe most) of the best Hollandaise sauce to be found in restaurants is made using this mix. It is yummy.<br /><br />It's easy to prepare, although it requires about five minutes of your undivided attention.<br /><br />Two Tips:<br />1.  With the large container, you save a LOT over the smaller packets. However, the smallest quantity you can make using the directions on the container is 1-2/3 quart. So, to make only one cup, ...<br /><br />Yield: 1 cup<br />Mix: 1 Fl. Oz.<br />Milk: 4.8 Fl. Oz.<br />Butter: 4.8 Tbs<br /><br />I don't think you have to measure the amounts REALLY carefully. I have been getting increasingly "relaxed" about my measuring, and it still comes out fine.<br /><br />2.  The first cup I made was very salty. I don't know if it was the salted butter, or that the mix had settled in the container. Regardless, I recommend, 1) that you shake up the container before the first use to ensure the mix is mixed, and 2) that you use unsalted butter.<br /><br />Lastly, in an attempt to be witty, I offer the following observation. Looking at the ingredients, note that no chickens are involved in the production of this stuff. Rather the mix is made with chicken FOOD (autolyzed and hydrolyzed) plus thiamine hydrochloride. It is reasonable to infer that the chicken's digestive system does the autolyzing and hydrolyzing, and her ovaries use thiamine hydrochloride to produce egg yolk. Thus, this food is truly "green" - omitting the energy-wasting, green-house gas-producing chicken.

It can be "adjusted" by adding a few squeezes of fresh lemon juice, or a very small dash of cayenne pepper, can be made into a very good replica of Sauce Bearnaise by adding dried tarragon and judicious amount of tarragon vinegar, and can be turned into Sauce Choron by adding a little tomato paste to the Sauce Bearnaise.  A great product with great possibilities - no competing manufacturer even comes close to Knorr with regard to this excellent product.

review/summary: Easy and inexpensive pantry staple - a squeeze of fresh lemon brightens it up.
review/text: We have been using Knorr products for many years, and this packaging is economical and convenient.<br /><br /> As others have said, you can play pretty fast and loose with the butter/milk ratio. My family likes it when prepared like this:<br /><br />melt 2-3 Tbs butter in a small saucepan and whisk in 1/4 C mix for about 30 seconds over low to med low heat.<br />add 1 C milk (we use 2%, but any works fine) and whisk constantly - or at least every few minutes- till thickened.<br />I squeeze half a fresh lemon into the sauce just before serving.<br /><br />You can easily adjust the measurements to make the sauce as thick/strong/buttery as you like, just as you would when making home-made hollandaise.<br />This is easier than making "easy" hollandaise by streaming hot clarified butter into a blender with egg yolks.... because I don't have to clean the blender afterwards- just my little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CM69">Cuisinart 719-16 Chef's Classic Stainless 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Cover</a><br /><br />Super easy 5 min sauce that is easy to keep in the pantry.<br /><br />No need for 2 huge containers? share it :)

review/summary: Decent, and there's a ton of it!
review/text: First - if you've never tried Knorr's hollandaise sauce - this is decent stuff.  It's nothing like you'd get if you successfully made it from scratch yourself or if you got it at a fine restaurant in tablespoon quantities but it's comparable to what you'd get at a diner where they serve you oodles of the stuff.  My guess is that this is what they use to make that.  As such it's definitely a reasonable solution to attempting to get it just right from scratch.<br /><br />Second - I had no idea how much there would be in this package, I just didn't do the math... each can is about the size of a large coffee can.<br /><br />You can mix it at any level of "fat" that you like - use skim milk and less butter or use whole milk and lots of butter, you control how high fat you want it to be.<br /><br />I could see buying this amount for a special large family gathering where you are serving a home cooked meal, maybe a group trip to the cabin or the beach, etc.  The advantage to this container if you only want a little is that unlike the little packets you get this you can make as little as you choose at a time without having an open packet gathering dust in your spice cabinet.

Ok, just add milk, unsalted butter and roll the dough then bake. Voila! Cinnamon heaven, right? Not so much. The dough was tough and tasteless and the cinnamon/sugar topping was stale. The buns didn't rise up at all and were unappetizing. When we went to bite into one it was like a rock. We trashed the whole batch. I wouldn't waste time or money on these, I'll just go back to making my own from scratch.

review/summary: Great tasting, but be careful of too much Omega-6
review/text: I like this hemp milk a lot. It's available in my area at Bed Bath & Beyond for cheaper than the current Amazon price. In terms of taste, consistency, and flavor, this is a great product. It's smooth and delicious. To me, it tastes like soy milk and the hemp ingredients are not detectable. It goes great in coffee.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, however, is the health claims of the product. The carton touts the high omega-6 content of this product and even shows a bar graph comparing it to soy milk and almond and rice milk. This product contains beneficial Omega-3 as well (found in things like fish oil an grains), but high omega-6 is not a good thing. Too much omega-6 can have negative effects on health because it is inflammatory. Most Americans already get too much omega-6 because it is very common in our diet (from plant oils). A University of Maryland Medical Center study found that Americans get 14-25x more omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />It is important to keep the ratio in balance, and some health researchers believe the optimal ratio is closer to 4:1 of omega-6 to omega-3 for lowering the risk for certain kinds of cancer. On PubMed, look for article ID: 12442909, "The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids."

review/summary: Great for kids with dairy/soy sensitivities
review/text: My 2.5 year old has been drinking this "milk" since he turned a year old.  It has been a great alternative to cow's milk and soymilk. It is fortified with vitamins and minerals, and it has a TON of omega 3s, 6s, and 9s!  I like that this "milk" has a bit of healthy fat in it, since that's good for growing children.  I am aware of the sugar in this product, but per 1 cup it has 9g of sugar whereas regular whole cow's milk has about 13g per cup.  The flavor is a bit earthy and strong for me; it's difficult for me to enjoy even though I do drink other grain milks (rice, soy, oat, etc) without a problem.  However, my son is used to it and drinks it just the same as other toddlers his age drink cow's milk.  I have tried the unsweetened, unflavored, and chocolate versions, but my son didn't like those. Our pediatrician recommended this milk alternative, and she said it was fine to give him the flavored/sweetened stuff.  The consistency is thicker than rice milk (the most common alternative for children who can't drink cow's milk or soymilk), so it works well when I'm cooking/baking.  When my infant baby girl turns 1, we will most definitely be giving her this milk product as well.<br /><br />I really can't say enough good stuff about this product.  I highly recommend it.

I find it to be delicious and a great substitute for dairy milk. Arguably better & healthier than dairy, soy, rice, almond and all of that other stuff! Don't get it in your mind that it should taste exactly like cow's milk, because it doesn't. Embrace it for what it is - a unique flavor and consistency that is very tasty, at least to me.

review/summary: Beware this product has carrageenan
review/text: I gave this product one star because it contains carrageenan which research has shown to proliferate cancer in animals. I was very excited to try this since I do not drink regular milk and I wanted a nutrient rich substitute for cow's milk to give my 1 year old son.  My review is not based on taste. I've never tasted this product and it arrived faster than estimated. Although carrageenan is a derivative of seaweed which I always thought was good for me, something may change in its processing as an emulsifier to make it less advantageous for the body. Nonetheless, You can research it for yourselves and make your own choice.

review/text: The taste and texture of this milk is great (much better than rice, almond, soy etc). However,I didn't realize that the Tempt Vanilla version of Living Harvest's Hemp Milk has sugar in it when I ordered it. Since eating sugar does not help get rid of Lyme disease, I'm going to go back to the Living Harvest Vanilla, which is sweetened with rice syrup (I think this is Ok for lyme diet).<br /><br />I know, I could purchase the unsweetened... That is OK for protein shakes with raspberries (boosts detox of liver), but I need something sweetened for my cereal.<br /><br />Now, if this Living Harvest Vanilla will go on Subscribe and Save...

review/summary: Repeat purchase, my little dogs love these, no strange ingredients
review/text: Easy to break in half, small in size to begin with, variety of flavors in the box, these economical boxes of dog treats are my household preference for the dry crunchy type. Repeat purchase. Good price. Will buy again.

review/text: I used to make dog biscuits because I didn't like all of the nasty stuff that's usually in dog treats. I don't have to worry about that with these little biscuits. Nothing nasty in them at all and my dogs love them!

review/text: Always buy USA made dog treats. These are a favorite of my pups and visiting pups. Have bought Blue Dog bakery products for years, so glad Amazon carries them since I can't get them locally.

review/summary: The BEST Dog Treats Ever - Hands Down
review/text: My dogs, Chihuahua's and German Shepherds LOVE Blue Dog All Natural Dog treats. I buy different ones. I bought these, the Super Stars just for my Chihuahua's because they are small, little smaller than quarter size I would say. They stay on their main food which is Blue Buffalo, but these are great for any occasion or just to say I love you.  Whenever they are extremely good, I say good girls and give a treat as a reward.  All Natural, great taste, (according to the dogs), and a great price.  You simply can't go wrong with these. A must have for your pet.

review/summary: scrumptious!
review/text: This is my 9th year of purchasing Blue Dog Bakery products and I am still very happy with their line of snacks. My two shelties just love them and I have used the  Super Stars not only as rewards for training but also for their night time cookie before bed. I always have my shirt pocket full for the neighborhood dogs when we go on walks, now I am the Pied Piper of dogs!<br />These products are always fresh and consistent in size color and taste, yes I said taste! I read years ago that people take these snacks with them hiking and share them with their dogs. There are human consumption quality. So I tried it, ok maybe I would prefer an Oreo, but they are not that bad at all. So now I test them on occasion to see if they are consistent, and they are. The Natural soft peanut butter chews, they look like Fig Newtons, stay fresh from the time I open the package till they are all gone. Now you never want to overdo it with snack because it is the fastest way to cause obesity in your pet. So I actually count out their cookies for the day and put them in a little tin to keep me for over doing it. This has helped me to control their weight and to help me remember how many I have given them.

review/summary: Awesome Deal
review/text: I have so many dogs that I have to have ALOT of treats and this was a great deal for 6 boxes. We got the Blue Dog Bakery Super Stars Assorted Small Dog Treats, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) each box is big enough for each dog (we have 20 right now)to get a couple treats at bedtime which is perfect. Will order again for sure!
