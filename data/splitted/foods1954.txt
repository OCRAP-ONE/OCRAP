review/summary: Retro Candy baskets make a unique gift for any occasion...one sure to bring back the memories
review/text: Have you ever been walking and heard a song on the radio and remembered something you thought long forgotten? Have you ever smelled something cooking that reminded you of growing up? Have you ever seen something that is so symbolic that you are transported back in mind? Our five senses are the strongest triggers of memory that we as humans possess, and this Retro Candy basket from the 1980's takes full advantage of that to make a perfect gift for the person who has every gadget, trinket, and item they ever needed.<br /><br />The 80s were the era of Atomic Fireballs, BitOHoney, Mamba, Nerds, Lik-m-aid Fun Dip, Bottlecaps, Wonka Pixy Stix, Bubble Gum Cigs, Candy Cigs, Apple Heads, Lemon Heads (small & large), Charms Blow Pops, Saf-T-Pops Lollipops, Sweetarts, Now & Laters Assorted Classic, Fun Gum Wax, Pop Rocks, Zotz Sour Fizz, Runts, Slo Pokes, Zours, Jolly Ranchers, Slap Stick, Grape Heads, Jaw Busters (small & large) and Tootsie Midgees. The only thing really missing from this basket is Big League Chew. According to the seller, some items may be substituted as they run out, but really, candy is candy, and there is enough in here for you and your friends, basically everything the kid in you still desires. And while the candy types may be 26 years old, the actual candy is fresh, sweet, and pure goodness just like you remember.<br /><br />Be warned however, there is enough sugar to make a rhino hyper and your dentist wealthy, so consume in moderation. You aren't 10 anymore. If you buy this for someone else, you will be highly tempted to devour the entire basket or slyly sneak out a few select choices.  There are several other sets in this product line, each with their own unique line-up, my favorite being the 70's box. Enjoy!

review/summary: Nostalgia in a box.
review/text: This item was purchased as a gift for my sister. As children of the 80's, we enjoyed our fair share of odd candies and surprisingly a majority of them were in this box. It was a lot of fun to reminisce about our childhood as she dug through the box and pulled out the candy. Overall, it is a really good buy between the 18-25$ range but I wouldn't have paid the 33$ asking price.

review/text: I was looking for something that a whole family could enjoy as a gift and something they wouldn't necessarily buy for themselves. My brother's family actually has a candy drawer in the house so I hesitated momentarily. My cousin's family is one with 3 generations living in the same house, again a momentary hesitation.<br />  I went ahead with the purchase because it is often hard to find some of the candies in this gift box. I never saw the contents, or the amount of each type of candy so all I have to go on is the comments I received about this gift.<br />  From one family they ranged from, "where did you get this- we want more" through "loved the nerds and pop rocks". Not too bad for ages ranging from 46 to 11 years.<br />  The other family actually put dibs on various pieces within the box. They wanted to each have a favorite piece nightly. The pecking order went from oldest to youngest.  The candy necklace and various "penny candy" pieces were relished. They enjoyed it tremendously.<br />  For those of you who are hesitant because it seems like a alot of money for candy that is not readily available at the stores so how popular could it be? The laughter,giggling and story telling about who wanted what and why that I heard has me convinced it was well worth the money.

review/text: This product arrived in about a week, and was exactly as described.  I am not sure if all the candy is exactly what I remember from the 80s.  Then again it is a gift, and not from the era I would have grown up with, so I'm not exactly an authority! ;)  I think it is a bit expensive for the quantity of candy, but if you need a gift for someone who has everything or you have no idea what to buy for, I think it is perfect.  And I would buy these again.

review/summary: BrokenBday
review/text: First, I was upset because I did not get an e-mail letting me know my package was delivered. Keep in mind, I live in FL and in a townhouse, so it was not left on my doorstep, but in my mailbox. Had I not checked to see the arrival time (which was supposedly tomorrow), I would not have not known it was delivered today. My candy would have sat in 80* degree humidity until I got home from work tomorrow. Then I opened the box and the handle to the present was already broken. Not that it's a big deal, but now I have to go buy a basket or bag to put it in and make it pretty again. I was very excited because my brother grew up in the 80's and this is his birthday present. Thought it was a very cool idea, but I ended up being pretty disappointed. I haven't even looked through the candy yet but I could tell you, for $30+ shipping, I was expecting a lot more... hopefully my brother will like it after I fix it up.

Perhaps I should have realized from the picture that it would have no cranberry flavor or scent and ordered the cranberry-apple instead.  I will return it to the company and they can compost it, because that is its only value. Laurence

review/summary: Superfood!
review/text: This is great stuff!  I did research on the benefits of flaxseed and with some reservations, decided to give flaxseed a try.  I am beyond thrilled I gave it a try.  I have been grinding it and mixing it in my protein shakes.  Not only is it filling (very high in fiber and protein), but it tastes great!  In addition to thickening my shakes, it gives them a nutty flavor.  And the best part is I am no longer constipated!  I am looking forward to broadening my use of flaxseed.  Those looking to improve their health and diet must give flaxseed a try.  Remember to keep it refrigerated for its nature is sensitive to rancidity.

review/summary: I'm obsessed
review/text: I'm hooked on this stuff!<br /><br />I keep some ground in the fridge alongside the whole seed... dump it on any kind of cereal for a fiber/omega infusion.<br /><br />I've added it to so many recipes, from banana bread to mac n'cheese, you'd think I was nuts!<br /><br />As it turns out, I find the addition to be mild/complementary enough that you can get away adding flax to so many things.<br />Salad or cereal are obvious choices but it is a pleasant mellow addition to pasta sauces, mac n'cheese, cookie recipes, you name it.<br /><br />And it works!<br /><br />My buddy didn't believe me until he added it to his morning oats...  he had been having some intestinal issues, let's just say, and now he's as regular as an atomic clock haha.<br /><br />Sort of showing off, I took a handful of seed and popped 'em in my mouth, and started munching away. I thought I might regret it but they were great! Easily satisfy any craving for a nutty snack and there's something satisfying about grinding the seed in your mouth... I know, I can be extreme. But these are just so PLEASANT.<br /><br />And you get a whole lot for cheap... try Prime and Subscribe and Save (you can always cancel) and you get a lot for a little.<br /><br />I was going to give some away as gifts but they kind of make you want to horde them.<br /><br />Easiest fiber infusion ever.<br /><br />Have fun.

review/summary: Excellent deal, fresh and convenient
review/text: I used to buy flax seeds in a local store in bulk, they were really cheap (a little more than 1$/lb) but I could not find any organic ones anywhere for less than 4$/lb.<br />Bob's Red Mill Organic flax seeds are really fresh, they do not smell rancid (like I happened sometimes with those bought from the local store), they come in 4 packages so you can easily freeze 3 of them. And are organic, which is important to me.<br />Also, they are convenient as a price. I did the math and they cost 2.81$/lb (2.38$/lb if you use the "subscribe and save", like I did). This is a great price for organic flax seeds. If you buy them from the official Bob's Red Mill website, they cost a lot more, it is about 25$ for these 3 packages.<br />To grind them, I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C2GWTI">Cuisinart SG-10 Electric Spice-and-Nut Grinder</a>. That's what I use and works great.

You should chew them up completely in order to access all the nutritiion.  Whole seeds are not broken down in your digestion system.  Others may think otherwise but once chewed I liken them to the taste of pecans.  They feel like they would be good for you when you eat them too.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: I have bought flaxseed from a lot of places, but this is one of the most reasonable in terms of ease and cost.  Yeah, there are occasional bits of things in with the flaxseed, but I have bought bags from other places which were far worse and, so far, Bob's Red Mill has not sold me a bag where the seeds had gone off already.<br /><br />Flaxseed is a wonder for digestion and generally good for you.  I keep mine in the fridge and grind up a batch each week (also kept in the fridge).  This reduces the chance of the oils in the flaxseed going "off."  (I have had some which did, and if the flax tastes funny and not gently nutty, then get rid of it.)  Don't buy the pre-ground stuff because it can go bad much more quickly.<br /><br />Bob's Flaxseed is now something I buy on a regular basis.

review/summary: Best mix...
review/text: GET ORGANIC UN-HULLED SEEDS THAT HAVE NUTRITIONAL VALUE SINCE HULLED SEEDS ARE EMPTY CALORIES, WORTHLESS...<br /><br />I have been consuming seeds for years. Unfortunately in the beginning not too many people knew (infact they still don't) that seeds like flax seed and sesame seed have no nutritional value unless;<br />1. Seeds are fresh, not old and rancid,<br />2. Grinded in a coffee grinder,<br />3. Consumed within few days,<br />4. Kept in the freezer,<br />5. Kept in a dark place not exposed to light,<br />6. Oils and supplements are worthless since it goes rancid.<br /><br />So for few years although I consumed those seeds, I got no nutritional value out of flax seed oil which was very expensive to purchase till I learned the above pointers. I can not grind sesame seed in the grinder since it is so oily and ruins the grinder. Flax seed is the best balancer. Regardless of that, I have to consume both seeds due to the high mineral content which is a necessity for my healthy diet. For years I have been doing blood test and my omega-3 has been much higher than the highest level required for my age, year after year. Although I consume fish, it is the flax seed that pushes my omega-3 higher.<br /><br />1. Sesame seed for calcium, protein, phytosterols and host of other minerals and vitamins<br />2. Flax seed for omega-3 fatty acids with no cholesterol, to increase good cholesterol HDL<br />3. Cocoa for antioxidants instead of eating chocolate with sugar and unnecessary additional additives<br />4. Protein isolate for a complete amino acid chain without the fat, cholesterol and extra calories<br />I mix it all with organic soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis to feel full and have all the necessary vitamins and minerals without much spike in my glucose, fat or calories.

review/summary: I like the nutty flavor
review/text: I like flaxseed somewhat nutty taste. I have added seeds to be part of my diet, I found them to be a helpful way to add more vitamin and fiber at relatively low cost of calories. Flaxseeds have a concentrated dose of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and essential fatty acids.  Flax flax has more omega-ss and phytoestrogens called lignans than any other food.<br /><br />Flaxseed are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the seeds into the container.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat flaxseed is in a smoothie. I blend 1 Tbsp. ground flaxseed, 1 cup juice (I vary which juice I use for variety), 1 banana, 1 Tbsp. avocado, and ice.<br /><br />In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.<br /><br />FLAXSEEDS<br />Nutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.<br /><br />HEMP SEEDS<br />Similar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.<br /><br />BUCKWHEAT GROATS<br />Soft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.<br /><br />WHEAT GERM<br />The flaky center of wheat kernels.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Flaxseed.. good quality and fresh.
review/text: This is the Best quality flaxseeds I have ever tried. Bob red mill's products are best in quality but little overpriced. However, Organic flaxseeds are not that expensive at all. There are No rocks or other unhealthy or nonfood items mixed with product. So, it is safe to eat without any doubt. Amazon's packaging and service is always best. I recommend this product to all, who are looking for safe natural super food like quinoa. As we all know, Flaxseeds, quinoa, sweet potato, broccoli, spinach, berries, tofu, carrots, and oats are the primary super food that are not only super nutritious but also help to reduce weight, cholesterol and other health problem. I personally experienced all benefits by eating those foods. So, go for it and buy Bob's red mill organic flaxseeds and other food. They are little pricey but it's not that bad.

review/text: At my doctor's advice, I've added flaxseed to my diet in order to help keep my cholesterol under control.  I pay about $9.00 a pound at my local health food store.  Going through a pound a month doesn't break the bank, but it adds up.  Buying in bulk (including shipping) saved me about 54%.

review/text: This flax seed brand is very good. I usually toast mine because they taste better this way on the cereal, oatmeal or as a snack. I have tried them raw, but unless they are grinded and added to the shake or something like that, they are not tasty. I like that the seeds are neutral, so you can add them pretty much anywhere. High in fiber, organic - what not to like?

review/text: I've started my dietary lifestyle change about 2 months ago and needed to starting eating more whole grain foods, nuts and seeds. Bob Red Mill whole raw flaxseed made these convenient for my busy life. I prefer to get my nutrients from plant sources rather than supplements so I grind about 1 cup and store in freezer and add about 2 tbs with my breakfast. I did not notice any earth in the bags so far. I highly recommend getting whole raw seeds and grind yourself and store grinded and whole seeds in freezer.

review/summary: Good Price, Good Food
review/text: Amazon has a really great price for this stuff, much better than grocery stores in my area. The flax seed itself is also good, nutty, dense when ground up, pretty much just what flax seed it supposed to be. These little seeds are packed with fiber and omega fats, which are very good for the heart and body overall. It's also easilly worked into my daily eating, ground up flax seeds can be used in just about anyhting, cereal, smoothies, pancakes, salads, or even just by itself. Bob's brand is probably the best one I've tried, they're consistant in size, color, texture, and taste; I'd recommend this brand over the others I've tried.

I mixed two spoons of ground flaxseeds with one spoon soy lecithin granuels in my cereal(oatmeal) every morning. It gives me so much energy for entire day work. People always comments me that I look 10 to 12 years younger than my age(50). I always tell them eat more oatmeal,flaxseed and soy lecithin everyday regularly. You will see the difference yourself. It is always cheaper and fresh product to buy from amazon.

review/summary: Delicious-Nutritious & Affordable SuperFood - High in Omega 3
review/text: Flaxseed is one of my all time favorite superfoods for many reasons. First, the flavor is perfect....enhances but never overwhelmvs other foods. Next, flaxseed is really nutritious and is one of the highest sources of the all important Omega 3 fatty acids but without the Mercury associated with high intake of fish products.<br /><br />It is important to use organic raw flaxseed...don't pollute your body woth toxins or pesticides in order to add something healthy. To use flaxseed you can add whole or grind to add to bread...provides a very nice flavor that does not overwhelm. It's one of the standard items we use in our whole grain seed/nut breakfast bread. You can also add to rice/other grains for a pilaf, toss in with salad or even soup, mix into hot breakfast cereal like fresh buckwheat or kamut.<br /><br />Super source of omega 3 plus other nutrients. Very affordable, stores well. Tastes great. Check out my other reviews for many more superfoods, kitchen accessories etc to help you eat great without the high cost!

review/summary: Bleached
review/text: I didn't realize til after I bought this that cake flour comes in bleached and unbleached varieties, not giving it a thought. They say bleached flour rises higher, but I can't attest to that.  In an Italian bread book I made a recipe that called for cake flour or AP flour; at the time I didn't have cake flour, so I used AP flour and the product was lovely. When I got this cake flour and did the recipe again, it was substandard and I made a note NOT to use cake flour for that recipe again. I don't know if all cake flours would have produced the same result, but, I am leary all the same.  All I know is that if a flour is bleached, that means it contains chemicals I'd rather not have. The box states that this flour is already pre-sifted.  The box also states that the contents may contain egg and milk ingredients which means I cannot use this for my toddler grandchild who is allergic to both of those things. I will try another brand and compare.

review/summary: Not for Picky Dogs
review/text: My two Maltese dogs enjoy eating Cesar canned food products, but for some reason they really do not like to eat this style of filets in sauce.  They would much rather eat the all mashed and ground up typical canned food style instead.  Both products made by Cesar, but my dogs would much rather prefer I not buy the filet style anymore!

review/summary: The best bottled water
review/text: At first, I was cruising Amazon looking for random products to review. What could be less deserving of a review than bottled water? But then I discovered that you can buy Fiji water on Amazon, and that's worth an actual, serious review.<br /><br />At the time of this review, the idea of bottled water is in question. It's harvested in one location, shipped to another location for filtering a bottling, and then shipped all over the world. You've got the plastic bottles and the energy used by the processing and shipping industry. I'm not a 'green' fanatic, but I know a lot of people seem to care about this. Fiji actually goes to great lengths to give back to the environment by way of protecting the areas where they find the water, by planting new trees, and probably other ways. According to their website, they'll soon be carbon negative. Personally, I don't think bottled water is that terrible. When you think about all the other industries polluting so much more, bottled water seems pretty harmless. Nevertheless, some people care, and those people can feel good about Figi water.<br /><br />Now on to taste. Water is water, right? Not when it's Fiji water. This is the single most pure-tasting water available. I've had all the premium brands, but I keep going back to Fiji. It uses a complex filtration system, explained in detail on their website. It is certainly more than glorified tap water. Unbelievably, the majority of bottled waters are tap water from wherever the packing center is located, maybe with a few added minerals for taste. Fiji is one of the few waters that is actually different than what comes out of your faucet at home.<br /><br />Fiji is plenty expensive, but it can't be beat. Enjoy.

review/summary: Pure and pristine
review/text: On my quest to improve my overall health, I have been on the lookout for the best water I can possibly find so I can flush my system of toxins and, at the same time, have glowing skin.  Although I keep trying different brands, I always come back to "Fiji", the natural artesian water from the islands of the same name. "Artesian" means that the water is protected inside a volcanic rock formed millions of years ago. Because it's bottle at the source, the water preserves all its minerals literally untouched. The difference is also obvious to the naked eye, when upon looking through the attractive bottle, one can see the clarity and transparency that just makes one want to dive into its purity.<br /><br />Taste-wise it does not dissapoint either. Imported from the distant falls of Viti Levu, Fiji tastes free of all particles and just... fresh! I usually keep a bottle by my desk at work, and use it hot or cold, for tea, hot cocoa, or straight up.<br /><br />The typical analysis in mg/liter states:<br /><br />Silica: 85<br />Calcium: 17<br />Magnesium: 13<br />pH: 7.5<br />Bicarbonates: 140<br />Total dissolved solids: 210<br /><br />Cases are offered at a discount at the company's website for delivery in the USA.

review/summary: very good but not perfect
review/text: Fiji bottled water is purified "through volcanic rock over hundreds of years." Well, that sounds nice and I believe that this water is purified before Fiji bottles it--but I'm not sure just how the water is filtered through volcanic rock. The water does taste good, however; and this is great either chilled or at room temperature in the colder months.<br /><br />The water also contains a mineral called silica which may help improve our overall health; it goes into more details on the bottle but I remain slightly less than convinced.<br /><br />On the bright side, the company that sells this has a website and a telephone number for customers to use in case we have further questions.<br /><br />Overall, Fiji bottled water is very, very good; but I'll never completely understand precisely how they filter it. I do believe that it is indeed filtered; and this is one of the better brands of filtered water. It doesn't appear to come from a spring, however.

review/text: This really is unfiltered honey made from wildflowers, so if you have allergies expect a reaction, at least initially. If you are planning to visit Central Florida on vacation this is a good buy to prep your immune system against the local flora. The flavor is a little stronger than single cultivar honeys, so you don't need as much to flavor your food and drink with. I detect more than a hint of honeysuckle in there. It's tasty, and the price is right.
