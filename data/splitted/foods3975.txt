review/summary: They did not list sucralose as an ingredient (saw it after purchase)
review/text: I was very disappointed in this item, which I thought would be 100% xylitol. It is a mixture of xylitol and SUCRALOSE (splenda). I would never have bought this dangerous sweetener, so I am pretty bummed I wasted my $$$.

review/summary: Not what I was hoping for
review/text: Since I am diabetic, I have tried every artificial sweetener on the market. For me, all of them have too much of a bitter aftertaste to be usable. I had read that xylitol is more or less a 'natural' product, and after having heard a professional chef give glowing reports of Ideal (xylitol) on a radio program, I ordered the three bulk forms of the product.<br />It tastes fine in beverages. Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute.<br />I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking. I'm very disappointed that Ideal does not perform at all well in baked goods.

review/summary: It Certainly isn't Healthy
review/text: I have a problem with many reviews calling this a "healthy" sweetener for it is NOT healthy, just a better substitute than many others out there. Although not a "healthy" sweetener, it taste great and taste pretty much just like the organic Sucant sugar I usually use for baking.<br /><br />The first ingredient in Ideal is Xylitol (not very sweet by itself) which is iffy with health foodies (they say it is too processed just like white sugar) and then Ideal adds two other ingredients that are definitely unhealthy. Maltrodextrin is more often than not derived from corn (usually GMO corn) which is NOT healthy and the other ingredient is Sucralose which is Splenda which is NOT healthy because your body cant recognize it and doesnt know what to do with it therefore making it harder on your system than sugar and harder to digest.<br /><br />I'm huge into whole food holistic eating and buy stevia leaves or stevia powder which is truly zero calories and not bad on your system; yet, it does have a minor aftertaste you have to get used to. If you are looking for a sweetener that is not unhealthy turn to 100% stevia and is fine for diabetics. Again, this Ideal brand xylitol is mixed with corn sweetener and splenda and although not healthy, does taste great!

review/summary: Looks like Sugar, Taste like Sugar
review/text: This is probably one of the best brand of sweetener available right now.  There are many sweeteners at supermarkets & grocery stores: like Equal, Splenda, Truvia, Purevia, etc...  But Ideal is my favorite for two reasons: Taste & Consistency.<br /><br />Taste: It's the closest thing you will get to sugar without being sugar.  In "my opinion", it ALMOST leaves none of the aftertaste that you come to expect from sweeteners like Sweet-N-Low (saccharin), Nutrasweet (aspartame), or to an extent Splenda (sucralose). Truvia & Purevia do taste like sugar initially, but I find they have a bitter aftertaste.  Ideal (xylitol) has a slight hint of non-sugar initially, that eventually subside and disappear.<br /><br />Consistency: It looks like sugar!! It is not powdery or too off-white or too dark. It's crystally like sugar. Actually, you could mistake it with real sugar by just the look of it.  The only thing that gives it away is the feel of it on your spoon or your hand.  It feels lighter than real sugar, almost fluffy (light 'n airy).<br /><br />One of the best thing about Ideal is it dissolves equally well in hot AND cold beverages, unlike real sugar.  I have not tried it for baking or sweet recipes, but have added to savory dishes and it is a worthy substitute.<br /><br />The only problem that I have with Ideal is you can't find it at many grocery stores or supermarket.  You need to order it on Amazon or look on their website where they get distributed.<br /><br />Overall, A++

review/summary: not a fan of the "zero calorie" claim
review/text: I've been able to use this sweetener in my recipes and things like coffee, tea, etc. It tastes like sugar - no bitterness or aftertaste. However, I find the "zero calorie" label misleading. They're allowed to say that the product has zero calories because each teaspoon has less than five, which is close enough for the FDA. However, if you're going to use it in baking, you will be adding some calories and carbohydrates. Each cup has 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs, according to their website. I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than sugar, but I think the packaging should give the statistics per cup instead of the rounded down "zeros" in a teaspoon.

review/summary: "Sugar" with positive dental benefits
review/text: I have purchased Ideal for about a year now but discovered that the product sold in the store was promotional and the big chains here in Massachusetts are not selling it.  Major Bummer.  I sent the Ideal folks an e-mail about the situation--they were the ones who told me about the distribution problems.<br /><br />Ideal contains as the first ingredient, Xylitol which is found in sugarless gum.  Xylitol has the benefit of being dentally positive (it actually promotes to a degree some dental benefits) whereas sugar as we all know is dentally negative (sugar is food for bacteria and the bacteria byproducts, poo as it is, causes dental caries).  That is the reason I use it. One only needs to calculate the cost of dental bills to decide to add Ideal to one's shopping list-- along with floss and fluoride rinse.<br /><br />I find the taste of Ideal to be better than sugar as there is no post sugar dryness in the mouth.  The pink, blue yellow and other fake sweetners have a horrible aftertaste which Ideal does not have (at least in coffee and ice tea). The only bummer is that the Ideal company is not doing a better job of promoting this product.  But such is life.<br /><br />I do agree with some writers that the Ideal folks should be upfront about calories.  Sadly the Ideal folks are following the letter of the law that allows companies to say no calorie when in fact there are calories.  The oil in the can spray products are a big offender here as they list their serving size to be 1/3 of a second but if one calculates the amount of fat calories in a small can it comes to about 1400 calories, all from fat.  Ideal should not take this route and should be upfront.  5 calories per teaspoon with diabetic and dental benefits is, in my book, a positive selling point.

I even asked Splenda when they were going to get with it and make a crunchy formula, and they acted like I was from Mars. Just one lil question, when are ya gonna be in stores?? Whine whine whine! Lol, just kiddn but I can't use my credit card too much but I'd gladly buy this stuff by the armload in my own grocery store. Please get in stores in the south when youse guys can!!

review/text: this is a wonderful product. it is sweet and no aftertaste. i don't mind an aftertaste to save calories but my mother is always bothered by it so doesn't like to eat the things i make if i make it with sucralose. i made a cake and some cookies and she thought they were made with sugar. so it passes her test :).<br /><br />two things i don't like about it is the "zero calorie" thing. it has about two hundred calories per cup so is misleading. basically all things that claim no calories are like this so they aren't the only ones but i still think it's false advertising.<br /><br />the other thing is that you only get four cups. sugar where i live costs less than half of this for a five pound bag. i have no problem spending money but buying this all the time would run anyone dry pretty quickly. i'll buy it again if it's on sale again but won't be a regular.<br /><br />anyone wanting to try this i suggest you do. it almost acts just like sugar. it just doesn't give as much volume as sugar does in recipes.

review/text: IDEAL No Calorie Sweetener is ..fantastic.  Have been  using it exclusively in pie baking.  Even though it says use in same amount as you would sugar, we find about a quarter more is needed to achieve the same sweetness.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie, fruit pies, even the filling for cream puffs.  You can't tell the difference and "sugar only" lovers do not have a word of complaint.<br /><br />Have not tried the brown or confectioners sweeteners yet, but will soon and expect them to be just as satisfactory.<br /><br />Delicious Cranberry Sauce:  One bag whole cranberries, one cup diet cola, one and a quarter cups Ideal and some grated orange peel.  Cook to boiling, simmer about half hour and set aside to cool.  Refrigerate overnight and enjoy the next day.Thickens up nicely and is really really good.<br /><br />Amazon is best place to find this, I bought 6 large bags last time as I never want to be without it in the house.

review/text: if you need or want a sugar substitute, this is by far the best tasting one, and that is what really matters.  Splenda can be too sweet, especially in tea and sprinkling matters.  Others have that funky after taste, like stevia does.  I hae baked with it and though it doesn't rise as well as sugar does it is better than the splenda does.  Xylitol has good dental reviews too.  And Ideal is a 99.95 % natural product and is common in many foods and natural items. I love it and Ive tried most of the products out there.  I buy it here on amazon becasue the one I can get at the local is more $$ and they don't have the brown or confectionary.  Can't wait to work with those too.

review/summary: Best sugar substitute, great for baking and canning
review/text: Ideal sweetener is the best sugar substitute I've found.  I even use it for canning, such as making sweet pickles, a light syrup for peaches, etc.  I've tried Splenda, but didn't like it as well, and got poor results in baking.  When I use Ideal for baking, the results are much improved.  One little hint:  Use Ideal in place of regular sugar, but also add a small amount of real sugar to the Ideal portion (say 1 Tbsp of sugar on top of 1 cup of Ideal) to get a better consistency in your baked goods.  The only problem I have found with this product is availability.  Our local grocery stores sell all kinds of Splenda, but have discontinued selling Ideal.  I wonder why.  Now I am forced to buy online.  Amazon's price has more than doubled since I bought it two months ago, so what's up with that???

Oatmeal, peanut-butter & sugar cookies are good, although still denser then regular cookies of same variety.

review/summary: The best artificial sweetener!
review/text: Ideal is a must try sweetener for those who rely on artificial sweeteners. It contains the same sweetening ingredient as sugar-free gum (xylitol) and is absolutely the best I've tried as far as imitating sugar. There is no after taste! It comes in a granulated, powdered and brown sugar version. The best!<br /><br />Warning: this product can be very hazardous to pets! The package is labelled as such (it states along with chocolate,grapes etc.) so be very careful not to leave it out where they can get at it. Their digestive system does not handle the enzymes the same way as humans.

review/summary: Favorite non-sugar dry sweetener
review/text: I have used xylitol for many years, and it is my favorite dry alternative to sugar. It is great for sweetening beverages, and can be used in some baking situations. Although, I will say this: sugar not only caramelizes (which makes cookies yummy) but it lends moisture to baked goods (which helps muffins and cakes be yummy). If you intend to use these things in baking, please keep these things in mind and adjust recipes accordingly. A cookie with all xylitol in it won't caramelize, and cakey things with all xylitol may end up dry and crumbly (depending on other ingredients). Hope this helps!

review/summary: Best sugar alternative out there
review/text: So it has sucrolose in it. So what? It tastes great and is a lot better for you then sugar. It fights tooth decay as opposed to sugar which causes it. Ideal has no vile after taste. Closest taste to sugar, and will make a diet easier to follow. If i used splenda i would go back to sugar, if i used stevia i would be broke, if i used sweet n low or equal i would vomit. Ideal is not better then sugar but it is a great substitute and will keep those insane amounts of sugar out of your diet if you drink your coffee like i do. I bought a bag today and i'm gonna clean out my sugar shaker and fill it with ideal.

review/summary: Absolutely the BEST Sugar Replacement!
review/text: I have been extremely satisfied with the quality of Ideal brand white and brown sugar. I have used both the white and brown sugar in everything including drink mixes, syrups, cakes, pies and caramels and couldn't be happier. The taste is fantastic and is indistinguishable from the real thing in cooking and baking! No one has even questioned the taste of drinks and foods I have prepared with it. I only wish Ideal sold larger bags of their sugar products!  Ideal sugars do not leave any strange after taste and are a welcome alternative to other "faux" sugar products available on the market.  Best of all...they have NO CALORIES!!!

review/summary: Goodbye Splenda!
review/text: I started using Splenda several years ago and was happy to find a sugar substitute that didn't leave an aftertaste.  Then I started doing research last year after hearing negative things about long term use of some of the chemicals in Splenda.  I found Ideal in the process and gave it a try.  I like the taste of it over Splenda and so far the scientist haven't found any bad things about it.....yet.  If you want to know how Ideal tastes just chew a stick of sugar free gum, it's got the same sweetener in it as Ideal.

review/summary: Fantastic Product
review/text: This is a fantastic product, I wish that it were more readily available.  I won't buy anything but this product, I believe it's the closest thing to real sugar that you could ever find.  Earlier in 2010 I decided to eliminate sugar from my diet as much as possible and watch my carb's.  Using only this product as a sugar substitute and limiting sugar & carb's from other products and without excercise I was able to lose 18 lbs.  My husband added excercise and he was able to lose 35 lbs and quit taking insulin(he is a diabetic). It is the best, most natural sugar substitute I have ever found(with the best taste)...also...I believe by eliminating the other chemically based sugar substitutes, no more headaches and appetite is more manageable.

review/text: This is a great sweetner, measures like sugar and tastes great.  It has Xylitol, with all the health benefits.  I'm looking forward to baking with it, to see if it retains its sweetness.  My first attempt, muffins that bake at 400, was disappointing.  The muffins were flavorless, but I'll try something at a lower baking temperature before I make a final decision.<br />One of the bags had a slight tear, and sweetner coated everything inside the box, although not a lot was wasted.  Since there was no sign of damage to the box, it appears the package was torn before it was packed. Be more careful, please, guys.

review/summary: Better for baking
review/text: I like this product because it is more like actual sugar in texture and weight, so it does better in baking.  Unlike another person's review, I would say it doesn't dissolve quickly in cold liquids.  It dissolves maybe a tad faster, but if you are a Sweet n Low person like me, you will have to remember to stir more. I also don't think it is as sweet as regular sugar, but I'm a person who likes things very sweet, so maybe for others it is fine.  Over all, I found it to be the best of the sugar substitutes, but like all substitutes, it costs too much.  When I first started using Sweet n Low way back when it was only $.79 a box (bulk - not in little envelopes).  Now it is around $4.00. Amazing. Also, Ideal isn't easy to find in my area (Los Angeles) so the internet was the only route for me.

review/text: Check out the review histories for some of the very enthusiastic people.<br /><br />Although this is a decent sugar substitute, it's not as satisfying as real sugar.  The aftertaste isn't 'green' the way Stevia products are and it's not actually unpleasant.  But no matter what I use it in, I can tell it's not the real thing.<br /><br />I may purchase it again but I am just as likely to try a different brand of Xylitol.<br /><br />Today there is a photo of the brown 'sugar' version, that is wrong.  This is a white 'sugar' substitute.

review/summary: Disgusting. Way too hot
review/text: I bought this cereal locally because it sounded good. Man, was I mistaken. It is like chewing on fireballs candy. I suppose if you like a burning sensation on your tongue when eating cereal this might be fine but I found it completely inedible. Simply disgusting and way over the top cinnamon taste. Really like chewing on a cinnamon stick or a fireball. I can't image who taste tested this. If there were zero stars I would give it that.

review/text: A friend suggested the Nature's Hollow jams, but I saw that this was a little less expensive, and it seemed so natural, being made on  a farm!  I was so looking forward to raspberry jam again, having been off sugar for awhile. This was a huge disappointment... really not good!  I  could not taste raspberries, more an off flavor, probably the xylitol or the monocalcium phosphate. I ordered 2 jars that really are not worth eating!  So, I'm planning to order Nature's Hollow, which is getting consistently good reviews!

review/summary: Check the expiration date
review/text: I have to admit that for me, the diet sodas were an acquired taste.  Now that it's acquired, I love them.  I drink caffeine free diet Coke whenever I want a soda late at night.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The flavor is crisp and clean with the added punch of carbonation.<br /><br />Just beware of the expiration date.  I got one once that tasted horribly and my husband told me to check the expiration date.  Sure enough, it was expired, and it hadn't been very long.  Lesson learned.  I don't buy them too close to the expiration date anymore.

review/summary: HAVE A COKE AND A SMILE? MAYBE I'VE HAD TOO MUCH!!!
review/text: The best thing about Diet Coke is basically the best thing about Diet Pepsi, you can find it anywhere and everywhere and it is always basically the same product. To a consumer that means one may safely buy and consume this hermetically-sealed product with the reasonable expectation of not getting sick from the local water. This is the advantage of the can over the fountain. Canned "Diet Coke" also will not go flat as fast as a two liter or even a twenty-ounce bottle. Now, all the hermetically-sealed products [cans and bottles] have expiration dates on each individual container, further insuring the safety and freshness of this universal product.<br /><br />As far as contents go, the exact ingredients are on the can. However, unlike Pepsi's informative website where I found the milligram amounts for all ingredients per 8-ounce serving, Coke's website [www.cocacola.com] dealt more with the history and lore of Coke products. Where Pepsi's site clearly stated exactly what was in the can, I can only assume from the list of ingredients on the can of Diet Coke, which is an almost exact match of Diet Pepsi's, that one will find roughly the same amounts of caffeine and sodium in each. At Pepsi's website we quickly see, that there are 30 mg. of sodium and 24 mg. of caffeine per 8-oz. serving. A 12-ounce can = 1.5 servings or 45 mg. of sodium and 36 mg. of caffeine. The exact amounts of these ingredients are important if you have family members or guests with high blood pressure [sodium] or young children prone to hyperactivity [caffeine]. It is important to remember that fountain drinks are reconstituted where they are sold and no bottler [Coke or Pepsi] guarantees the exact amounts of caffeine or salt (or anything, for that matter) in the drink or the purity of the water used in reconstituting the fountain product -- a great argument for cans and bottles!<br /><br />As far as which brand is best, some think Diet Pepsi goes flat quicker than Diet Coke. Maybe, however, the smallness of a 12- ounce container would negate any difference if it exists since it is quickly consumed. As for myself, I rarely drink carbonated beverages, but when I am on the road with the kids and we all need to rehydrate, I know that canned Diet Coke [or Diet Pepsi] is safe and effective and, most of all, available wherever we might be.<br /><br />[PS- I am not affiliated with Coca-Cola, Pepsi or any other product.]

review/text: I must admit, I enjoy home made shortbread in the Scottish Style with my Scotch! My sister-in-law, Madelon, is an excellent baker and has provided me with homemade Scottish shortbread in the past, which I have thoroughly enjoyed . This Walker's Shortbread is very good and I have just ordered my second 21.2 ounce tin. It is very buttery and rich and I do believe that it tastes very much like homemade. My wife has developed a taste for the cookie without the scotch accompaniment. There were only a couple of cookies in the tin that were scrambled, which did not bother me. I believe that this is a good value. I do not often rate items that I have purchased on Amazon. This is an exception. Enjoy the cookies if you do decide to buy!

The seller is also very nice to work with.

review/text: These Cashew nib clusters are very satisfying. The box literally lasts me for a few weeks because you only need to eat a few pieces to curb the craving for something sweet.  I also like to bring these with me after a workout in case I want a snack.  I particularly like that the Cashews are raw, that they use organic ingredients and sweeten with coconut nectar rather than Agave as most companies do.  These aren't overly sweet either.  They are just right.  It's a nice balance between all the ingredients.

review/summary: Delicious and Truly Raw
review/text: There were no reviews, but, based on the ingredients and somewhat reasonable price, I took a leap of faith and tried these. Glad I did! They are delicious!<br /><br />The first bite was strange because we didn't know what to expect. They are only slightly sweet (from the coconut nectar), with a tart/bitter hint (probably mostly from the cacao). Because the cashews are dehydrated after they are soaked in the coconut nectar, these are not at all chewy, like a mainstream "cluster" might be. Personally, I do not like chewy, so this is a good thing. Consecutive bites got more and more delicious as we knew what to expect. They are VERY TASTY, but not in that "addictive" way where you crave them and unconsciously eat the whole box and then feel awful afterward. I think it's because the taste is full and satisfying and they fulfill a nutritional need that the body and mind feel satisfied after a single serving. Just my guess. I still wouldn't leave the box open and eat from it, though (after all, they are really good!); so, pouring out an appropriate amount into a small bowl also helps keep snacking in check!<br /><br />The box says the cashews are truly raw and even explains how some "raw" cashews are not really raw and that the term is often used simply to differentiate from roasted cashews, even when the product claimed to be raw has been cooked or boiled, mostly for shell removal. Really raw cashews (sometimes called "truly raw") are supposedly best for you because they retain their healthy nutritional profile and the enzymes are not killed off in the heat. In my experience, these are also more difficult to find and are somewhat more expensive than just mainstream raw cashews.<br /><br />The cashews are mostly in small bits and large pieces, interspersed with a well-balanced amount of organic cacao nibs. Many clusters are nicely-sized, about an inch+ in diameter. Because they are not chewy, this size is a good size for snacking. There are also many itty bits of cashews and separated cacao nibs in the bottom. This can be used as a dessert topping or simply scooped up and eaten, in hand.<br /><br />It is believed that the whole cashew is better than the cashew in pieces, because less oxidation can occur in the whole cashew (less surface area to oxidize). But, realistically, this is eaten as more of a healthful snack than the main part of a healthful meal, so, as long as you are getting good nutrients elsewhere, this will serve as a nice compliment to that.<br /><br />Note: a cotyledon is defined as the first leaf of a seedling (I had to look it up). I haven't seen any, but am not really worried about it. Being veg, I eat leaves all the time. Good to know what it is, if I do spot one in the clusters though.<br /><br />I plan to continue buying these, and am on the S&S plan, so if you have specific questions about the product, that have not been answered in the description or my review, feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to respond informatively.<br /><br />I rely on Amazon to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)

review/text: I am not much for Earl Greys; to me, they tend to be average. This one is not. It has a great, but not at all overpowering, bergamot flavor. The bergamot flavor is smoothed out by the slight hint of vanilla and cream that is barely noticeable, but effective). I normally drink tea with milk but prefer this one on its own because it is so tasty, smooth, and absolutely well balanced. It avoids the bitterness often gotten from black tea and from lesser Earl Greys. Because of its flavor and its (relatively) decent price, I think this tea will become a mainstay in my house.

I don't know if UPS had left them in the hot truck too long or what (maybe I'm just too picky), but they were not exactly as expected. I called the company and within two days had a brand new case (with a nice bonus) on the doorstep in perfect condition. The representatives for this company are beyond all doubt, extraordinary. Usually, Amazon is the first place I look for products that I cannot find locally or cheaply enough, but in this case, I would suggest ordering directly from Geraldines.

When you bit them they had a unique crystally magic crunch texture. When you bit it it came apart in flaky layers.<br /><br />Today when I bought one I was worried as the package was different. Also on the inside I knew it was different because the old bars used to be surrounded by a wax cardboard liner on 3 sides, now the new one had it only on the bottom. I could see that the new bar did not have chocolate swirls even though it was marble. The old ones you could clearly see chocolate swirls.<br />The new one: first bite, dry, no velvet crystal crunch texture, no tearing off and leaving flaky layers extending. It was not oily. AND WORST OF ALL: IT HAD NO FLAVOR! AND EVEN WORSE: IT HAS A SOUR RANCID TASTE AND THERE IS NO DATE ON PAKCAGE. SHAME ON YOU JOYVA FOR CHANGING THE RECIPE. MORONS

There was supposed to be an ice pack keeping the bars cold but when I received the package, the ice pack was a bag of warm water.  However, the Halvah is fine and a great flaky-like sesame treat. It's always been too many calories but really, what has just a few calories that's any good anyhow?

review/summary: This Purchase Was a Mistake
review/text: Tried the first one and wish I didn't have the rest of the 36 bars to eat through. Grainy paste texture and a very bitter aftertaste. It was my first time to try halvah. Sorry, but I recommend that maybe Amazon think about food samplers for people to try new products without the large outlay of money.
