review/summary: this has worked out great
review/text: i have 2 athletic toy dogs, affenpinschers, they go on daily walks. apparently doctors are advising daily walks and little dogs are now everywhere. guess it helps the walk:) we saw 4 little dogs just on our small walk this morning. the problem is that the stores around here haven't moved along with this trend and everytime i go to the store the dog treats are EMPTY.  try explaining that to a dog???  yeah, does not go well. i saw this monthly subscription when i signed up for a subscription for ensure (also hit and miss on a empty shelf around here) and thought i would try it to see what i would get.  i got fresh treats, a whole case. the dogs were in shock that the ups man brought them a whole case of treats but they and I are very happy with this. i have a dog with allergys who is not allergic to these or the jumbones so i can't write a review based on whether these treats are enjoyed more than others cause they don't get the others so????? sorry bout that one.

review/text: I have two small dachshunds.  One was a stray with very bad teeth.  She couldn't even chew dry dog food much less the harder tartar treats.  I started giving the smallest Dentastix to both dogs, one in the morning and one at night.  By the time I took my stray back to the vet for her exam, the vet couldn't believe how much her teeth had improved.  Very little tartar left.  She now has very little difficulty eating anything.  Both dogs love their treats and listen for the bag in the morning and at night.

review/summary: Best Sausage taste & first bite crunch
review/text: Purchased Saag's German Franks from Amazon. I don't know<br />what I was expecting since I only have supermarket type franks<br />to base my taste standards on. But what a surprise. The Saag's<br />German Franks are at whole new level for me. The initial taste and<br />first bite crunch due to real casings is a real taste treat. The flavor,<br />texture, and the satisfying crunch are how real sausages are supposed<br />to taste but sadly, the commercial brands we are exposed to are<br />lacking, compared to these sausages. They are almost twice the<br />cost of store bought franks, but oh what a treat to experience what<br />Germans have been eating as opposed to us Americans. I will<br />Forever be jaded eating common sausages.

review/summary: Stanley wants seconds!
review/text: Stanley may not be the best source for food reviews, since he generally eats anything he can fit into his mouth and seems to enjoy it, but the fact is, he is very fussy about dog food.  I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this "Gravy with Beef" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word "choosy" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing.

review/summary: Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough
review/text: When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses "...it's mostly water," our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the "beef and liver" chunks in the future.

review/summary: Pedigree Dog Food, why I give if 5 Stars
review/text: I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen.

review/summary: For those  who like mild coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced.

review/summary: Caffeine Kick Without the Stomach Burn
review/text: After trying this new roast at the store and loving it, I was thrilled when I was offered a free sample of the k-cups to try on my office machine.<br /><br />Same as the store brew, mellow taste (to me that means no burnt after taste) and a high caffeine hit.  I am not a coffee aficionado so I cannot tell you about the cocoa or toasted nutty flavors that they tout.  What I can say, is that if you are looking for a simple blend that will give you the morning or afternoon kick that you need without leaving an acid stomach burn, try this coffee.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive as compared to brewing your own coffee from store bought beans in your Mr. Coffee, but that is the point.  You are brewing a fresh cup in the comfort of your own home without having to get out of your fuzzy slippers or in some cases, brushing your teeth.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a luxury and stop complaining.

review/summary: Best Coffee From Starbucks Yet, But, It Comes at a Price..
review/text: Brewed on the 10 oz. setting on my Keurig Platinum brewer, the first thing I noticed was the very nice, enticing aroma.  Could this possibly be the perfect K-cup?  I had to have a sip before I even sat down.  In that first sip I tasted some strength, some choclate and nutty overtones, followed by a smoothness I don't typically find in a Starbucks blend.<br /><br />For  the most part I don't drink Starbucks for several reasons.  First and foremost, they tend to over roast their beans and the result is an overly strong and somewhat bitter brew.  This Veranda Blend "Blond" brew isn't roasted so darkly and finally I can taste the real flavors in the coffee.  This coffee actually reminds me of what a good "Donut Shop" coffee used to taste like; before everything became darkly roasted.  But I stray...  The first sip as I said was very inviting with lots of interesting flavors and a lively yet balanced acidity.  As the coffee cooled in my cup the flavor changed a little.  It became more woodsy and earthy but with a bit more acidity.  Still a good cup that comes close to my favorite K-cup, Millstone's Fog Lifter.  Foglifter is a blend of both dark and light roasts in which the flavor doesn't change as the cup cools, the first sip is as good as the last.  The acidity is always balanced whereas with this Veranda Blend the acidity becomes slightly more pronouncd.<br /><br />I usually prefer a light to medium roast in the morning and throughout the day.  In the evening I like to relax with a darker roast or better yet with a real espresso (which sadly cannot be made in a Keurig).  My verdict for the Veranda Roast is that it will fill the bill for my everyday coffee if and when the Millstone Foglifter either isn't available at a reasonable price or is out of stock.<br /><br />The price you pay for this good Veranda Roast is, well, the price, and this is my reason for the deduction of a star.  Starbucks has long been priced higher than other coffees and the Veranda is no exception.  This is only a 16-count box which means we're paying right at a dollar a cup.  At the Keurig website I can buy Foglifter for around sixty-two cents per cup when it is in stock.  Am I being cheap?  Maybe.  I just don't find Starbucks to be worth the extra money just to have the brand name.

If you want Starbucks Blonde, buy a bag and get one of the ecobrew cups and make it that way.<br />Update:  I went and kept track of the number of cups I could get from a bag, and you can easily get 25 cups from one bag which costs about half of what these k-cups do.  I won't post prices, but you can do the math.

Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!

review/summary: Is this even coffee?
review/text: I usually brew a Lg setting cup and the first time I tried Veranda, it tasted like a coffee flavored Chai. Extremely weak coffee. For people who don't enjoy coffee. And of course, WAY over priced. Why is starbux almost 5 dollars more than all the other brands? In this economy? Guess he really needs the cash to fund more illegal settlements. The weakest coffee I've ever had. Horrible.<br /><br />Whats more? Theres a starbax on a corner not far from my house (go figure)...and it's amusing to see the lemmings line up around the building to pay $5 for a cup of coffee, when 3 blocks over is a small mom & pop Cuban grocery (family owned) that makes the best Cuban coffee this side of the everglades, made fresh to order. Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine.

Once you are finished cooking, you mix everything together and serve.  The spice mixes make cooking delicious Indian biryani easy.

review/summary: Horrible Artificial Flavor
review/text: This peach tea honestly tastes like it was flavored with peach-scented soap.  The tea itself is probably fine, but the flavoring that they used is overpowering and barely resembles peach flavor.  After I opened the package, a cheap, artificial peach scent filled the entire room, which was not bad in itself, but the soapy taste made this tea completely unacceptable.  It sounds cruel to say this, but the flavor of this tea is closer to peach shampoo than peach tea.

review/text: I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />After trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NH09R8">Tea's Etc Oolong Tea, Orange Blossom, 3-Ounce</a> I expected this one to taste fantastic as well. On the first few flavor notes it does taste great: you get the mild black tea with peach flavor that builds quickly. Towards the end and a bit after it starts to taste a little off. I'm not sure if it's the sunflower flavor coming out or something else, but it just isn't for me.<br /><br />If you like peach tea and you need $3 to hit your $25 minimum, I'd say give it a shot. You can see the chunks of real peach and it smells great; it could just be my taster that's off.

review/text: I always wondered why Prego never came out with a vodka sauce; they've given us quality spaghetti sauces for gererations, and their name is synonymous with Italian home cooked meals. Finally I got my wish, and was eager to give this new product a try. I'm pleased to say that I really loved the flavor, as it isn't too tangy or sour, but rather creamy and with just the right amount of spices, garlic and sweetness. There's nothing about this vodka sauce that's  over the top; it's a very consistent flavor that finishes off your favorite pasta dish. I'm glad that Prego took the time to produce this product; it has been worth the wait for me. I recommend this quality vodka sauce.

I really like the fact that these are organic treats, they're chicken and they have sweet potato so my dog is not just eating chicken, she's getting a vegetable too.  I was buying the Mellow Mutt chicken treats and I thought my dog loved those.  She did but she loves these more.  Now she won't even eat the Mellow mutt treats, she refuses, because all she wants is these.  Dogswell keep doing what you're doing.  When my Whole foods was not selling your treats I wrote a note every time I went in asking them to sell them.  I did the same thing at my Local Target.  Now both sell the treats, but of course I have a hard time buying them because they can't keep these treats in stock.  Everyone loves them.

This drink is very heavily blue, so dont drink around friends if you dont want to have blue teeth for an hour or so. The taste was excellent, a blue candy raspberry flavor.

The other tea is incredible, this stuff is not as great. The smell of it is pretty identical to bubblegum, and the taste is just not quite as subtle or delicious, and also tastes a tad more chemically. The bottom line is that some may love this tea, I just prefer other varieties of Passion Fruit / Tropical Blend tea by a wide margin.<br />On the other hand, the price I paid for it seemed quite reasonable for 20oz of tea, and further each comes in a handy resealable pouch.

review/text: I am a veterinary technician and work at a clinic that sells Breathalyser. I use this product for my cocker spaniel as well. It is a great product IF USED CORRECTLY! If you take the time to read the back, only 1 cap full goes into 1 pint of water for small breeds and 2 cap fulls into 1 quart for large breeds. Yes Xylitol is an ingredient but it is NOT fatal if you take the time to portion the product right and read the container. If you are concerned if your breed falls into the large or small category, chose the small dose to keep safe. Another fact is to not let the Breathalyser settle, once it is in your animal's water bowl. After 24 hours, replace the water and clean the bowl out before giving more. Adding more water and Breathalyser whenever it gets low is not how it is intended.

review/text: I strongly urge Amazon.com to pull this product. My employer has a yorkie, and she almost lost her pet because of this very product. Xylitol, the third item on the Breathalyser ingredient list, has been proven to be a toxic chemical to animals. It's been shown that as little as three grams can be fatal to a medium-sized dog. It causes precipitous hypoglycemia, liver damage, blood-clotting problems, and dehydration. Google "xylitol pet health" for more info, and check it out on snopes.com. Also check out avma.org (american veterinary medical association) and do a search on xylitol.

They say the same thing about Xylitol and humans, but I've eaten tons of it and I'm in perfect health.<br /><br />Do more research on xylitol before you believe these idiots. It kills bacteria in your mouth and prevents cavities much better than fluoride, which really is bad for your (and your pets) health.<br /><br />Maybe tiny breeds, that already have hypoglycemic problems, would have an issue with this product, but use this product with confidence on most dogs. My dog has way outlived the lifespan of her breed and she's still as lively as can be.

review/text: Our ancient dog, two ancient cats and now two young cats all used the Xylitol laced Breathalyser Plus and experienced no ill effects.  Plaque buildup was minimized so dental infections and work were all but eliminated.  The population reduction in the household had nothing to do with Zylitol and everything to do with old age, cancer and stroke. I do wish Imtrex would identify concentrations of active ingredients. A little math would likely show there to be at most a gram in the 500ml bottle,  I also wonder if the Xylitol is an essential plaque reducing agent.  Their website suggests it is.

My 3 Chihuahuas don't seem to display any aversion to the water with the product added. I gave it an entirely (yet) unearned three stars.<br />.<br />Update, 10-13-08 A NEW issue: The posts relating to the xylitol in this product REALLY concern me. Quick research seems to bear out the warning posted by others. The product hasn't adversly affected my pets, but I'm still not convinced of the legitimacy of its intended use. My dogs are remarkably free of tartar build-up, but that could also be the result of EXCLUSIVE dry dog food ONLY. No table scraps...etc. A big "Con": This product DOES promote mildew or some kind of black yuck at the edge of the water in the watering dish! It's relatively expensive, difficult to accurately determine its benefits, and might be potentially dangerous.<br />The xylitol makes the product very sweet, so the water is made even more palatable to the dogs. So, unfortunately, is ethylene glycol (antifreeze). Connection? I don't think so. Just an observation.<br /><br />.<br />I re-rate this product no (as in zero) stars. I will order no more.

review/summary: Dangerous for cats!
review/text: I have 3 cats, and bought this product to help reduce tartar on their teeth and freshen their breath.  I thought this would be a good alternative to putting them under to have our vet clean their teeth.  I thought I had thoroughly investigated the ingredients beforehand.<br /><br />Luckily our cats were due for their annual check-up at our vet.  Our oldest cat, Aztec, is 10 years old.  Since she is a 'senior' cat she has blood drawn once a year to catch anything that might be going on with her.  Well, this time her liver levels were off.  I immediately poured the rest of this Breathalyser down the drain, not taking any chances in giving this product to our cats.<br /><br />I researched again, and found that zylitol causes serious problems for dogs, but there was no research showing a problem for cats.  I AM WRITING THIS TO INFORM CAT OWNERS NOT TO TAKE A CHANCE WITH THIS PRODUCT.  While I can't prove that Breatalyser caused this liver problem for Aztec, it's highly likely.  This is the only new thing that had been introduced to her diet.<br /><br />Aztec is now on a medication for her liver for a month.  Hopefully when she goes back to the vet, her liver levels will be back to normal.<br /><br />DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!

review/text: This white tea has a very pleasant flavor - mild and on the sweet side.  It's a good choice for relaxing and sipping.  The price for white tea was very reasonable and its being in smaller, resealable pouches helps preserve it. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Nice taste, not too much powder
review/text: This compares favorably to the other white teas I've had. I'm no connoisseur, but I'll try: Not planty or bitter like some I've tried, but mellow and almost fruity when paired with a quality honey. The taste stays pleasant even when allowed to cool, so this might be good for those that like their tea cold.<br /><br />For those afraid of getting loose tea: just heat water in a measuring cup, throw the tea in there (however much clings to a spoon x the number of cups) and stir briefly, then strain into a cup or thermos after 3 minutes. Rinse the strainer and measuring cup, bam, done. You don't need a tea ball or a special pot or anything. Experiment with tea amount and water temperature. It's like science!

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: This tea has added rose petals which affect the taste, and take away from the expected sweet and "jammy" flavor.<br />Also the leaves are chopped up and not long and twisted as other white teas I've bought have been.<br />There were no instructions on brewing so I used 2 tsps per cup (as I had with other white teas), so perhaps I made it too strong....<br />It's OK and the price is good, but I think I would spend a little more and get a more "pure" white tea next time.

review/text: I was trying to tell my 91 year old auntie about "bubble tea."  She just didn't get it.  Then one day we were out in Palm Desert and saw an advertisement for it inside a shopping mall.  We walked the length of the mall to the food court, and wouldn't you know ?? THE BUBBLE TEA STAND WAS CLOSED !! that day.  So, I couldn't even let her experience it after we had walked so far to get it!!  I mailed the milk tea kit to my sister. (Aunt Ruth is Scot-English, she puts milk in tea) so that my sister could make the bubble tea for her.  So she can't experience the heat sealed plastic cup top, at least she can swallow the big bubbles !!  Bubble Tea just isn't readily available around 29 Palms, CA.  Thank you for letting bubble tea be part of her "bucket list."  !!

When I travel and I see The illy sign outside a deli or a coffee-house I know I am going to get a good cup of coffee....<br />But..When I bought this here Moka roast I must admit I am a little disappointed. Not much punch here. it's not like the Moka coffee I was use to when I was living in Europe. We europeans when we think of caffe Moka we consider it a much more dense and stronger cup of coffee.. a darker and more dense roasting of the beans as well.<br />A good somewhat darker cup of coffee, Yes..but no Moka...<br />Not enough "Moka" in this one illy, sorry, back to the lab again and give us a real Moka, Please.....<br /><br />Hugs

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Love coffee, dark and strong. Bought a Bialetti Moka stovetop aluminum to re-create the expressos we have had in Europe. I bought a bag of Lavazza Crema Gusto in Naples last October. That was excellent first experience with the coffee maker. Lots of flavor and not too bitter. This stuff is just the opposite. Lots of bitter and not too much flavor. The closest comparison is Starbucks Pike's Peak. More bite than taste. I am baffled because this is supposed to be the best. It is also made for this exact Moka stovetop. The coffee smells like it tastes too. The Lavazza smelled rich. This one smells acrid rich. I would go for something else. I would also try it from a local retailer if you choose to try it. just a hunch on that. As in wherever this stuff is stored it may not be beneficial to the contents. If this was the first coffee I brewed in the Bialetti I would not be using it much.

review/summary: Not bad but pricey
review/text: Coffee ground specifically for stovetop espresso pots is pretty hard to find so I'm always curious whenever I discover a new brand.  I was especially looking forward to tasting illy because of all the rave reviews.<br /><br />I've brewed this coffee in a couple of different sized moka pots and each time it produced a nice smooth cup of espresso, which made for great cappuccinos and lattes.  Compared to Lavazza Caffe Espresso, the illy has a bolder, slightly charred flavor thanks to the darker roast.  Some people may not like it for that reason, but I find Lavazza a bit mild for my taste and this is just dark enough without being too bitter.<br /><br />With that said, it's unlikely I'll be buying illy again.  Compared to most ground and whole bean coffee sold elsewhere, its pretty overpriced for a pre-ground coffee.  I tend to buy my coffee fresh whenever possible and use the pre-ground stuff occasionally.  A pound of freshly ground Italian espresso roast coffee at Whole Foods or your neighborhood coffee shop makes tastier coffee and is far cheaper than a can of illy.  Lavazza, still a perfectly acceptable coffee, and Cafe Bustelo, a dark roast Cuban blend (my current favorite) are both better values for pre-ground espresso.  Both are less than half the price of illy.

review/text: After reading prior reviews I felt confident about placing this order since people mentioned next day delivery.  But I did it late in the day on a Friday (for a birthday the following Wednesday) and was perturbed to see the order wouldn't go out until the following week.  Then I got an acknowledgement email that said it would not ship until Tuesday, with a two to six day delivery window, i.e., Thursday at the earliest.  Sigh!<br /><br />To my amazed and more-than-pleased surprise, the flowers were actually delivered on Tuesday!  According to my sister, they come direct from Honduras, Holland or Costa Rica ... hers came from Honduras.  And that's the small part of this five-star rating.<br /><br />The flowers were absolutely fresh, lavish/plentiful, beautiful, with wonderful colors ... everyone in her office raved about them, with one woman able to specifically identify a special Honduran rose she was familiar with.  The price is great, too, especially in view of what you get.<br /><br />I certainly know where I will be ordering flowers in the future.  My sister, too.  We're both completely thrilled and pleased.

I was also told that I cannot receive a refund or a delivery with signature. As far as I know any reputable company would leave a note to pick up their item from the local USPS if no one is home and would not leave it at the door.

Early next day, I received an apology from Falcon Farms, with the offer to resend the order.  Fearing a repeat of the disaster from FedEx, I asked to change the ship-to address.  That was done and Falcon Farms shipped, overnight and at no charge, another box of flowers.  I am well pleased with the product and even more so with the prompt, no-hassle customer service.

SO i would have to say this is a great product depending on what time of year you order it.  In the spring and summer they look great but in the winter the flowers don't survive the cold as well. But overall a great product and my mom,mom-in-law,and g-ma have all liked these flowers.

review/text: When I ordered this Boquet on line I was a little sceptical. What would it look like when it arrived? What condition would it be when it got here. I was surprised to say the least. It was beautiful, all the flowers were fresh and my wife really enjoyed her Mother's Day gift.<br /><br />  Thank you Amazon for a job well done. You have a happy customer.

review/summary: Mom raved about it
review/text: I never saw them except for the picture she sent.  It didn't look as good as the stock photo though.  I ordered it on Tuesday and it arrived on Friday even though the tracking for it said it would be Monday or Tuesday.  She said the cold packs were still cold when it arrived.  They didn't look great when they showed up but she said they drank tons of water when she put them in a vase and perked up and looked great afterwards. I order from them again in the future.

review/summary: Beautiful, big bouquet
review/text: I ordered this bouquet for my Mother-in-Law as a late Mother's day present. It arrived on the day I selected, which also happened to be the day she had been in a car accident. When she arrived home, there was an enormous box containing the flowers. She was overjoyed with the bouquet and when I saw it a few days later, it was still gorgeous and enormous. I would definitely order this product again.

review/summary: Pleasing arrangement
review/text: I've ordered this bouquet several times for delivery all over the country.  On each occasion they were delivered on time and the flowers were fresh and brilliant.  This particular bouquet enhances moods.  It lifts spirits and triggers a good state of mind.<br /><br />The bouquet has surprises.  The gerbera daisies have been red with large capitulum.  The mini carnations were a light rose color.  I think from the reports I got that the mix of flowers varies, but the bouquet is large and impressive.  It has a mix of colors, shapes and textures.
