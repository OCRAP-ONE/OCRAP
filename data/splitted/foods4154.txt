review/summary: Duck Flavor makes my 2 dogs throw up
review/text: Every time, every time, we give our two dogs their nightly pepcid in one-half of an "allergy formula," duck flavored pill pocket, they throw up hours later, whereas they don't throw up if we use the beef or chicken flavor.

review/summary: Be careful, made 1 of my dogs very ill
review/text: I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these.  However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google "pill pockets diarrhea", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.

review/summary: Dog loves them, makes life easier!
review/text: I have a fussy eater on my hands and a VERY smart dog.  I've used hot dogs, banana, peanut butter, etc... he eventually figured out a pill was in every one of those and would either refuse it, spit it out, or eat around the pill.  My boy has to take pills twice a day probably forever; so far so good on pill pockets - it's been over a year and he hasn't figured it out.  He considers it a treat and LOVES them.  They are soft so I can form the pocket around the pill.  To make them last a bit longer, I split it in half since his pills aren't very big.

review/summary: Perfect for Giving Medications to Our Dogs
review/text: Every month, we give our three dogs (two Aussies and a Golden/Flat-Coat Retriever mix) pills for flea/tick/worm repellant.  In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.  We found Pill Pockets is the very best way to do this.  Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.  Everybody is happy, and the dogs get the required meds.

review/text: We have tried all the various flavors of Pill Pockets for our dogs. One has a twice a day pill she takes and the other once a day. Chicken and Beef work ok most times but the dogs have never not wanted to take their pill when we use this Duck flavor.<br /><br />The consistency is excellent for being able to wrap around a small pill or to break apart and use only half at a time if needed. The smell is just enough to help hide the scent of the pills. The dogs just love it when I open up the pouch and come running to take their pills.

review/text: Our cat doesn't like the feline Pill Pockets so much, but he loves these canine beef ones. (Our vet said it was fine to give him doggie PPs.) And, the pieces are big, so I can use only half a Pill Pocket each day for his pills--saves me money. (I take the half Pill Pocket and split it in half, as he takes two pills a day.) Anyone who has ever had to "pill" a cat knows what a relief it is to just give a treat and the pilling is done. Great product.

review/summary: These are large, the cat size is smaller and has more
review/text: I love these, we have a cat that is impossible to administer pills to, but she goes stark freaking INSANE for these pill pockets. We used the feline size, which has more pockets in it than the dog size. However at one point she had to take a couple of pills at the same time and I could not fit all the pills into the cat-size pocket, so I bought the dog size. All kitty knew was hey, I'm getting a BIGGER treat than normal!<br /><br />If you have a dog that takes micro doses of tablets or just one small tablet, get the cat size and they'll go much farther.<br /><br />I purchased the chicken dog pockets for my cat and she loved them. That seems to be the flavor most of my cats like.

review/summary: Used for heartworm pill ~
review/text: My Maltese pup was given a chewable heartworm combo pill to use and the first time I offered it to him, he all but ran away.  Lucky me, I was prepared because I had already purchased these pill pockets.  I carefully slipped the heartworm pill into one and pinched it closed, then gave him the good boy talk.  He took the pill pocket and thoroughly enjoyed eating it, including the insert.  Problem solved.<br /><br />Whoever came up with this idea has my thanks.  These would have saved me a lot of trouble in the past with other dogs.  I just hope Puka doesn't catch on as he gets older.  I'm thinking about giving him a pinch of one every now and then to reinforce it being a treat instead of medicine.  They are very soft and sticky and apparently very tasty.

review/summary: Warning: using this product may have unintended side effects
review/text: This is both a blessing and a curse.  The blessing part is these pill pockets are pretty much perfect.  They take a pill very nicely, cover it, and make it wonderfully desirable for the dog to eat the pills.  "Serve with food because it's so bitter your dog will hate you forever" is not a match for these little suckers.  Little dog loves these, and would happily snarf down the entire packet if she could.  As for the curse... well, you can no longer safely move pill containers anywhere.  With a keen ear and a taste for beef pill pockets, your dog will hear you shift your containers even one nanometer and come running, expecting you to give it a treat.  My Dad has to take pills twice daily... you can see why this is an issue.<br /><br />Sealed air tight for freshness.  Approximately 30 to a bag.  Suitable for small pills.  Tasty, yet functional.  A fantastic delivery system for an otherwise annoying problem.  5 stars.

review/summary: Worked perfectly
review/text: I have great animals that are usually willing to do whatever I ask of them.  Unfortunately my male dog gets anal gland infections once or twice a year.  I have tried many ways of administering his antibiotics from coating with peanut butter/cream cheese or wrapping in slices of cheese.  All of these methods work for the first few days but over time he decides the treat isn't worth while so I end up forcing the pill down his throat and giving a treat afterwards as a reward for being tolerant.  Eventually he starts refusing his treat and looks at me like I'm abusing him, lol.  So this time I decided to try Greenies pill pockets.  I chose the capsule size since they are supposed to be larger and he needed to take three pills at a time.  I also chose the duck and pea formula to provide a unique flavor.  Each night he watched me place the antibiotics in the pocket and form a nice ball then eagerly took his treat.  They apparently smell very appealing as my female dog also begged for them and we have to store them in a cabinet because the cat tried to help himself by chewing on the bag.  By the end of the first week, all three animals would line up in the kitchen at the end of the night waiting for their treat!  They did leave a strong smelling oily residue on my fingers but washed off quickly and easily with just a little water and friction.  Purchased through Amazon with Prime shipping.  Arrive quickly in perfect condition.

Since they're used to getting them, they won't realize there's a pill in there if/when the time comes that they have to take some medicine.  Highly recommended in beef flavor or peanut butter.

review/summary: Helpful to get pickey eaters to take their medication.
review/text: My one doxie won't eat either the chicken or beef flavored pill pockets, but he will eat the "Duck and Pea" flavor; this is also the formula to buy if your dog has allergies.  The product smells quite strong when you first open the pouch; I suspect the peas give it that distinct odor. I don't need to use the entire pocket per pill, so I break a section off of the capsule just large enough to encapsulate the size pill I need to administer, forming the soft, pliable substance around it.  It is most economical to buy the capsule size, so I do so, but they also come in a smaller, pill size shape.<br /><br />I haven't purchased the pill pockets for my cats yet and don't know how they would be received, but this product has helped me give my dogs medication.  Even when the pill is supposedly chewable, and "liver-flavored," my dogs will generally not take their medication willingly unless I disguise it first.  These can make your life with your pet easier. Shop around for the best price as these can be a bit expensive if you have to use them frequently.

review/summary: Wonderful as always; my dog adores these!
review/text: Although these don't have the most pleasant scent, their effectiveness render's my nose's experience immaterial. These Greenies never fail to fulfill their purpose; once thoroughly surrounded by the pill pocket, any pill, capsule, or necessity I'd otherwise have to battle to shove down my dog's throat gets gobbled up. Actually, swallowed without chewing is more accurate. My dog has become increasingly sensitive with age, and she has shown signs of mild to severe allergies, digestive, dermatological and other manifestations. Not once has she experienced any hint of an adverse reaction to these. Without hesitation, I strongly recommend this product and flavor. These are a staple in our house, and I will continue to purchase these pill pockets in the pea and duck formula monthly.

review/summary: Probably A Good Product, Just Not For Sweet Girl!
review/text: When I got these in the mail last Saturday and opened them up, put in a pill that she absolutely hates the smell of, offered it to her and she gulped it down we were thrilled to death!  We have not been able to get this dog to take this particular medication using everything from hot dogs to hamburgers and several kinds of cheese, so when she ate this thing like it was candy my wife and I were both excited.  Then that afternoon for her last dose for the day, same performance.  We thought we had found the answer to our prayers as she has a disease that can't be cured if she doesn't take this medication until it's all gone.  So this was a Godsend!<br /><br />But, the very next morning, before she had anything else to eat, my wife tried to give her a pill using a Pocket and she turned her nose up at it and walked away!!  She tried several times with varying amounts of the pocket cut off to make it smaller for her and easier to gulp down.  Still no go.  So we waited a couple of hours, without feeding her anything at all, tried again, same thing.<br /><br />So I saw a bag of Pockets in Walmart and the only thing they had besides Beef was Duck so I tried that.  Same thing.  Wouldn't even eat one so we're back to looking for something else that might work.  If your dog will eat them they are GREAT!!

review/text: Pill pockets are ideal for giving drugs to dogs, much easier than squashing pills into a piece of cheese!  Our dog sees daily pill times as a treat now and comes and sits patiently waiting.  We are on our 4th packet of these and will definitely order more whenever we are giving drugs to dogs!

review/summary: These are indeed Life Savers
review/text: If you've ever tried to get your dog to swallow pills, you know how wonderful these are.  We have four dogs (three Corgis and a mixed breed), and all like them, and these have been successful with them all.<br /><br />Our mixed breed dog was about 13, and her disease was terminal, and we weren't ready to lose her (not that anyone ever is).  We had medicines that would make her comfortable in her final stages, but the problem was getting her to take them...we tried all sorts of things: peanut butter, apple sauce, fruit, meat--all had a certain ability to disguise the taste, but she got wise to them pretty quickly.<br /><br />But the Greenies Pill Pockets ALWAYS worked.  We were able to extend her life, with comfort, for a couple of months longer, and for that I'll always be grateful.<br /><br />A NOTE: The Greenies come in several flavors (chicken, beef, duck & peas), sizes, and also flavors for cats.  If you need to be more economical, you can also "shave" them down by squeezing off a little of them (depending on the strength of the pill they're taking).

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: We have had a number of cats with medical problems and tried any number of ways to get pills into them.  Pill Pockets are by far the easiest method.<br /><br />Most of our animals have considered Pill Pockets as "treats" and readily eaten them.  Our current feline gets three pockets in the morning and three in the evening, so we go through a lot.<br /><br />One suggestion:  if your smaller pet needs to take many meds, buy the pockets designed for capsuls for dogs.  Product pricing seems to be related to the number of "doses", rather than the weight.  I believe the small package for cats is 1.6 oz and costs only a few $ less than this 6.6 oz package. If you go through the pockets like we do, the savings are substantial.  We simply tear off a piece of the larger pocket and wrap it around the pill.  It takes 15 seconds.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to get a selection of flavors.  Our cat goes through periods where certain flavors are unacceptable, so it is good to alternate and have backups.<br /><br />If you are really desperate, you can always use human meat baby food.  We haven't seen a cat yet that would't take that.<br /><br />Summary:  A much better way to give your pet meds than a pill shooter.

review/summary: Fabulous product for small pills!
review/text: First off, I have found that buying these treats on Amazon is cheaper than purchasing them at PetSmart. I buy the capsule version of the Pill Pockets versus the tablet version because the bags are larger (it holds more ounces) and the cost difference is almost nothing. I then break that one capsule up into many pieces because they are soft & malleable. I am able to get that one bag to last me for many servings. I only use it to wrap up my dog's Prozac pill.  He will gobble it down with no problem. However, if I try to use any larger pill such as a Heartworm pill or Allergy pill in them, he will eat the treat part off & spit out the medicinal pill. For those types of pills, I just crush them up and stir them in some wet food for him.

review/text: we tried alot of things to hide pills in.  our dog would maybe fall for it once or twice, but then would spit out the pills and eat the cheese, peanut butter, hot dog, etc. that it was wrapped in.  But then we found pill pockets and he likes them enough to eat them and the pill inside.  the best thing is how easy it is to form them around different pills, and how you can only use pieces of one pill pocket on smaller pills to make them stretch farther.

review/text: These pill pockets are the easiest way to get a dog to take its meds.  My dog scarfs them down no problem.  They can be kind of pricey, especially if you have a dog that requires daily medication, as they only come 30 in a pack and retail for $7.99 (cheaper on amazon of course!).  I would definitely recommend them if you have a dog that has trouble taking his pills.

review/text: Like most dogs I have met, our dogs HATE getting their meds. These things take the headache out of giving medication to dogs.  The dogs get so excited for these pill pockets, and they are easy to use.  The pockets are very soft, so if you live in a hot and humid place, they will turn into a pile of mush.  However, you can easily just take a piece of mush and wrap it around the pill.  The dogs don't care if it is shaped properly or not.  Our dogs just swallow it hole and sit there waiting for another one.

Even though the box says you can't make "scrambled eggs" with it I thought it was<br />worth a try since I just needed to dip them in the egg, milk mixture.  Well, needless to say, we had to buy more bread<br />because we wanted to have french toast again the next day.  =)

review/text: Great product. Life saver for those who can't consume eggs. Has worked in every baked recipe I have tried. Definitely recommend.<br /><br />SLIGHT CONS:<br />- You can't TASTE the difference between this and when you use an egg. However, the TEXTURE and CONSISTENCY of foods does change a bit. I found baked items (especially cookies, brownies, and cakes) to be a lot chewier and when a few days old, a lot more dense/hard than when I have made the items with real eggs.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you can't have egg, this will allow you to still make baked goods with a simple substitution. Thank goodness for this product!

review/text: I bought two 17.6 oz cans.  Both are marked with 12/2010 packing date and 12/2012 expiration date.  This coffee is absolutely bland, nothing like Effendi I have had before this order, from a different vendor.  Either it was stale before it was canned or there might be another possible explanation.  The text on either can is in Turkish and German.  The same brand bought before, from a different vendor, was in Turkish and English.  Perhaps, for German market, it is supposed to be bland but I doubt it.  The largest Turkish community outside of Turkey would not drink this stuff.<br /><br />I got full refund from Amazon.<br /><br />I strongly recommend to buy your Mehmet Effendi from another vendor and to make sure the text on the can is in Turkish and English.

review/summary: The real thing.
review/text: (This review is very similar to one I did for another brand.)<br /><br />Let me start by saying that, while not a snob or connoisseur, I have tried just about every method of making coffee known to humanity. Drip, perk, pump and steam espresso, Aeropress, Neopolitan, Canadian-made coffee bags, Toddy concentrate and everything but pan boiled with eggshells. I've ground my own beans and even roasted them in small quantities. (I must have been an alchemist in a previous time!) Most of my gear (La Pavoni espresso machine, Capresso pump machine, Capresso conical grinder, countless Bialetti pots, Revereware stainless drippers, etc.,) have come from fortunate thrift store finds.<br /><br />My interest in Turkish style coffee came about with the purchase (online auction-used) of an ASTOUNDING Turkish-made fully electronic, sensor controlled masterpiece of an automatic maker from Beko which is even easy to clean! It has won awards from CeBIT, the world's largest and most international computer expo. Atat&uuml;rk would be proud!<br /><br />I found that my grinder could produce very close to the powder-like nature of ground Turkish coffee. But I wanted to try "the real thing," so I ordered this brand and another. This brand is from Turkey and comes in an attractive almost collectable metal can.<br /><br />My biggest surprise was that the coffee is not as dark roasted as what I had used before. But very pleasant with (traditionally) sugar or without.<br /><br />If you have a local coffee supplier with the gear to REALLY grind down to Turkish style, you are in luck. If not, give this a try. Standard stove-top boiler pots are cheap, but the Bekos are not. As all coffee tends to come from the same sources, I suspect I will be able to find similar quality locally, grind it or have it ground, and store it in this can.  Makes it easy to spot the Turkish grind!

review/summary: Wonderful, Rich Body...Love the caffeine.
review/text: This is, without a doubt, the best Turkish Coffee I have ever tried.  Very sophisticated taste.  Unfortunately, I am not a coffee connoisseur.  But I prefer this to anything made at Starbucks, Peetes or Diedrichs.  If you love the taste of coffee and haven't tried any Turkish Coffee before, this is the genuine article.  I just brew mine in a simmering pot over the stove.  No fancy gizmos.  Not that I wouldn't love to try to make it in one of those tiny pots, but my house is filled with every Ronco infomercial kitchen appliance since 1989 and I don't have any more room.  Plus, its like 3 of those pots to one of my coffee cups.  Finally, this stuff lasts forever and a day. It should take me a month or two to finish it.

review/text: It is one of the best Turkish coffee available!  I love Turkey and went there twice.  Every time I was there, I always ordered their cai (tea) or Mehmet Efendi Coffee.  I'm so glad that it is available from Amazon.com<br /><br />There is a little tips in brewing Turkish or Greek coffee.<br /><br />1) Use filtered water if possible.  It does make a difference.<br /><br />2) Use medium high heat.<br /><br />3) When you place the pot on the stove, ensure you don't over boil it.  After it is boiled for 1-2 minutes, the coffee should have very tiny-bubbled foam.  If you have BIG bubbles - you are over boiling it. Turn down the temperature.<br /><br />4) Once the tiny-bubbled foam starts to rise up, remove it from the stove and spoon the foam into you cup.  Within seconds, place it back to the stove and continue to boil it w/medium to medium high heat.  After 10-15 seconds, your coffee is ready to be served. To me, the tiny-bubbled foam makes the coffee smoother.<br /><br />It takes a few good trys to make a perfect cup - Enjoy!

review/summary: Acquired taste
review/text: I am an avid coffee drinker and have tried many different types of coffee. I had Turkish coffee many times except my friend always ground her own and I liked the flavor of her coffee. I was grinding my own coffee and preferred the taste over this Turkish  coffee. While this coffee is ground to perfection and was not expired ( it actually has another year and a half) as well as packaged in a great canister that easily fits in the refrigerator , My taste buds are not adjusting to the flavor. Mehmet Efendi Turkish Coffee has a very earthy almost topsoil earthy flavor. Not that I've tasted topsoil but the smell of topsoil is how this coffee tastes to me. That's about as good as I can explain it. Like I stated earlier it is an acquired taste and I am in no way stating it is terrible coffee but before you purchase this consider buying your own favorite coffee bean and grinding it to a fine powder. I use the magic bullet to grind my coffee beans and it works great.

review/text: I've been looking for this gum for a long time.  For some reason, I haven't been able to find Rain-blo at my local stores. They only carry Dubble Bubble- which I don't like because the flavor doesn't last long. The gum was delivered quickly and was fresh tasting.  The package brings 48 packages (4 gums per pack).  Just in case you were wondering, the gum balls are medium seized - not the jumbo or smaller bite sized options. You end up paying about .27 per package, not a bad deal. Definitely worth it.

review/text: Most excellent gluten free brownie mix. My kids love it. Very chocolately.<br />The batter will be runny but it is okay. Remember to grease pan before putting in batter in as it sticks. I missed a place and it stuck good. Takes 30 minutes to cook. Will be shiny on top, make sure center has risen up height of sides or middle will be gooey.<br /><br />If you can eat and like nuts, like me I put 1/4 cup olive oil and coated bottom of pan, the sprinkled chopped walnuts Diamond Walnuts, Finely Diced, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6) in bottom of pan. the poured batter over.  So easy scoop out piece and flip over on plate with walnuts on top. If you want to be fancy squirt chocolate sauce zigzag around brownie on plate then, put ice cream on top for brownie sundae. Can then put whip cream on top of ice cream or just use whip cream. Squirt chocolate sauce over topping. Then ad few more walnuts or not and top with cherry.

review/summary: Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili: Great packaging, but...
review/text: It was the packaging that sold us with this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7DTC">Leonard Mountain Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili</a> when my son and I were online here, looking for some interesting new chili variations. This one seemed different from some of the others, so we bought this pack of three 12oz bags. Not cheap, but it seemed interesting at the time.<br /><br />We unpacked the shipment upon arrival, and found that each one had the following:<br /><br />> One genuine Boot Scootin' burlap bag, with a drawstring (see the user photo)<br />> One miniature bottle of genuine Tabasco� green pepper sauce, enough for one person.<br />> Chili Seasonings, containing onions, garlic, salt, black pepper and green chilies<br />> 10 oz. of whole pinto beans<br /><br />The nutritional info states the following: Serving Size 12 oz. Servings Per Container About 6, Calories 90, Calories from Fat 10, Total Fat 1g, Saturated Fat 0g, Trans Fat 0g, Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 101mg, Total Carbs 19g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 1g, Protein 2g, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 4%, Iron 2%. Based on a 2,000 calorie diet.<br /><br />The Product Description was quite unusual, to say the least:<br /><br />"Uncle Charlie jus adds in sum of his real special dried green tabascy plants to het up this chili. Now the boys `round these parts reely lak this chili bettrn the red sissy chili. Most the womens think the green's a little hot fer thur sweet lips."<br /><br />Taste Test:<br /><br />Without all of the boring details, we followed the enclosed directions to the letter, adding ground beef to keep the initial batch as simple as possible. It smelled good as it was cooking, but we had to increase the cooking time, simmering it gently for an extra hour as it was a little flat. Let's just say that it was disappointing, and that's an understatement. For the next attempt, we tried the time tested method of cooking the chili the day before, letting it cool down, then refrigerating the batch overnight to give all the flavors time to blend. That was a very slight improvement, but not by much. Let's just say that it was reminiscent of some chili that I once had at an obscure New Jersey diner that's no longer in business. There never was a third attempt.<br /><br />Sometimes it's just better to do it yourself. This is the recipe that I use for "DIY Slow Cooked Chili" that I learned years ago when living in the South, and the one that I fall back on when in the mood for cooking:<br /><br />* 2 lb. ground beef<br />* 1 1/2 cups chopped onions<br />* 1/2 cup chopped green pepper<br />* 2 garlic cloves, finely cut (not chopped)<br />* 28 oz. can whole tomatoes<br />* 2 (16 oz.) cans kidney beans<br />* 2 tbsp. chili powder<br />* 2 tsp. salt<br />* 2 tsp. cumin<br />* 2 tsp. black pepper<br /><br />Brown the ground beef; add onions, green pepper, garlic, tomatoes, kidney bens, salt, chili powder, pepper and cumin in a slow cooker or crock pot. Cover and simmer on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Serve with cornbread and whatever hot sauce you like. Looking forward to trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JHROIM">Tabanero Hot Sauce Picante</a>, as it's been highly recommended.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />This company also makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007680BD0">Redneck Chill E SPICY</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00767OJDO">Redneck Habanerah Allives</a> (you'll just have to look at that one), but to date this reviewer has resisted the temptation to try either of these or their other offerings. However, I did receive a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7F8G">Leonard Mountain 3 Amigos Enchilada Stew</a> as a gift from a friend, and this product was easily worth a 5-star recommendation. That was one of the reasons that I tried their chili mix. Go figure.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Cannot say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7DTC">Leonard Mountain Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili</a> was the worst chili mix that I've ever had, but it's probably borderline close. What one pays for here is cute slogans and clever packaging, and this product is highly overpriced for what you get. Sad to say, even those chili seasoning packets you find in the spice section of your grocery store are better. But the burlap bag packaging was clever, and my son kept the miniature Tabasco green pepper sauce bottle, so I'll give it one star each for the creative packaging and the tiny Tabasco bottle.<br /><br />9/4/2012

review/summary: Great teapot, missing tuffy steeper
review/text: This is a great teapot. It's attractive, well-balanced, and truly doesn't drip.<br /><br />The lid fits on with a plastic seal that is pushed onto the pot, which prevents drips even when the pot is tilted at an extreme angle.<br /><br />Inevitably, there's some sort of spillage involved with teapots, whether from the teapot itself (though not in this case), or by putting things into the water or taking them out. In order to deal with this, there's a channel around the lid that catches the water and holds it there, instead of all over the sides or the table.<br /><br />As a whole, it's very well designed and I'm pleased with the teapot.<br /><br />The only downside was that the Tuffy Steeper, which is stated in the product description as included, was not when I purchased this item from Amazon. I got a slight  refund from Amazon, though not enough to buy the Steeper (which only comes in three-packs on Amazon, a fact which the customer service representative at Amazon couldn't seem to understand). Amazon's issues isn't the teapot's, however, so I would still recommend the teapot, especially if they've fixed the issue.

review/summary: Very nice and dripless!
review/text: This is really a great tea pot, absolutely love it.  It's high gloss black and the handle is realistic for normal hands.  There's a pull ring on top to take the lid off, was a little concerned I'd break it pulling off to lid.  The lid has a silicone gasket to make sure that it doesn't fall forward when you pour.  It can easily be removed.  The notch in the back for the tea bag has ample room for a chain attached infuser.  There is a channel at the top, flat portion of the teapot so make sure you dry any splashed water when filling the pot (as seen in the detail shots).  The tip of the spot has a nub which is difficult to see in these pictures.  The spout is squared and all of the tea makes it out of the pot.  Pours fairly quickly since the spout opening is a little larger. It stays hot for a while, slight benefit from priming the pot with hot tap water before adding tea and boiling water.  It does not have any obstruction like a screen inside of the pot so lose teas will not stop it from pouring. The underside of the teapot was finished well so it did not scratch the tray or table.<br /><br />Stylistically it's difficult to pin down, but it's highly functional. It is made to utilize the accessories this company also sells which explains the lid being more for function than contributing to the style. With cottage/traditional it's more modern looking, against modern it looks somewhat traditional.  Like an interesting blend of modern, traditional and art deco.  The black is very deep, but it's not an enamel black.  Hand wash is easy with the larger opening on top.<br /><br />The steeper mentioned in another review was mentioned when I purchased this teapot, but it was not included.  The box contains the teapot and the lid (with silicone gasket), there are no other parts included.  This are hand made I've read.  The enamel on mine was much better looking than the pictures (which look like the enamel ran a little thin since you can see the ceramic showing through).<br /><br />Overall, fantastic!

Very different taste, but a nice spread for bread or crackers (use same as peanut butter) or for eating by the spoonful. Also can be used to make peabutter cookies. Amazon needs to find a cheaper source, though. Shouldn't have to pay that much when buying a 3-pack. Subscribe & Save would be nice... Or at least "fulfilled by Amazon" so we can get free shipping easily by combining ordered items.

I don't care for the fact that the packaging lacks the ability to conveniently dispose of your used gum in a wrapper like most other gums, but that's just the way of Dentyne gums. You have to find a tissue of a piece of paper if you're not near a trash can ;-) Otherwise, the Peppermint is by far my favorite flavor. I also reviewed the Arctic Chill, which is much too strong...I would not recommend it! But the peppermint is a nice flavor. Still strong, but not overwhelming. Like the other reviewer, I was fortunate to test this product, and found the Peppermint to be something I would definitely be purchasing in the future!

review/summary: Awesome tasting gum in a very convenient package!
review/text: I am so excited about Dentyne Split2Fit packs and just the gum itself. Dentyne has long been a great gum - one you can count on to freshen your breath and keep your teeth and mouth healthy. But with the new package design, it just got easier to take this gum anywhere you are. I am a skinny jeans kind of girl and I am loving the fact that these packages split into the perfect size to stash in my pocket without causing a weird little bulge. I also am not real big on carrying a purse everywhere I go, but these packages pretty much fit anywhere! I stashed them in my skinny jeans, my shirt pocket and my little clutch on a girls night out. I have always felt like a package of gum added bulk to my life but with this gum, that isn't true anymore. And on top of the convenient packaging, this is a fabulous gum with great flavors. The taste is incredibly fresh and vibrant - much better than I can get with brushing my teeth and I appreciate having that just brushed feeling no matter where I am. This is a really great product and I feel I was really lucky to get a sample from bzzagent and Dentyne.

review/summary: Hands Down Best Sweet Potato Chips
review/text: I was never much of a sweet potato fan, but was shopping in Whole Foods and trying to find a snack conducive to my gluten free diet and decided to try these. They are DELICIOUS! Just 3 simple ingredients and they are much tastier than any other potato chip. I recently tried 'Food Should Taste Good' brand sweet potato chips and was really disappointed... Glories are MUCH better! Glories sweet potato chips have the perfect amount of crunch and salt--others are either too crunchy or not salty enough! Can't recommend this yummy (and healthy) snack enough!

review/summary: Unbelievably good!
review/text: These are ridiculously good. I grab a bag whenever I'm a TJ Maxx (and whenever they aren't sold out alredy!) I don't know how they taste so good, but they're better than any other chips. They taste almost exactly like the sweet potato chips from Cheeseburger In Paradise, but better because they're more full-bodies and flavorful. YUM! The only negative is you don't get much in one bag.

review/summary: Watch your teeth!
review/text: I love Abba-Zaba but I think I overdid it with buying an entire 24 bars at the same time. Taffy always pulls on the fillings, so that is just the nature of the beast we are dealing with here. Nonetheless, it's a great candy bar that brings back great memories.
