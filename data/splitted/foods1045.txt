review/summary: Plastic in the food!
review/text: Wow, i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars. The other posters say they notified Earth's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling!! No more earth's best for my little guy. I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars. They gotta do better than this to get my business.

review/summary: My baby's favorite 2nd stage food so far and great for constipation!
review/text: I like the Earth's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein.

review/text: This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far.

review/text: I would love to say that I have the time to make my son's food everyday. Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.

review/summary: Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others
review/text: My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.

review/summary: FOUND SHREDDED PLASTIC IN THE BABY FOOD!!!!
review/text: I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing.

review/text: We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein.

review/text: The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.

review/summary: My daughter's favorite jarred food
review/text: My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!

review/summary: the only jarred baby food my son ate
review/text: From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.

However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.

review/summary: How to cook salted cod.
review/text: I have not bought any salted cod from Amazon as yet but shall be doing so in a matter of days. This review is about cooking the salted fish to make it tasty.  First you take out the amount of fish you will need to cook depending on the size of your family. Next you wash and put your fish in a big bowl with enough water to cover it in the bowl.  Let sit for overnight.  Next day when you are ready to begin cooking, you will pour off the water on fish and get a pot and once again place fish in pot with enough water to cover it and let it cook for ten minutes then pour off boiling water and putting tap water on the fish again.  Use this time to debone the fish and break it into small pieces taste fish to see if it is too salty to taste, if it is soak it in water for half an hour more or boil it for ten more minutes.  Be warned that salted cod fish shrinks when cooked.  If fish is  to your taste then you will need an onion sliced,three plum tomatoes or nine cherry tomatoes sliced drain water from fish, heat skillet  and add some cooking oil and saute onion and tomatoes then add fish and stir every thing together.  Add black pepper and then add a little water so as to make a little sauce.  You can tweak the taste by adding a little garlic to the mix, putting it in at the same time as onion and tomatoes. You can eat this cooked up fish with bread and pita chips or on a bed of steamed white rice.

review/text: I sent an email to the supplier, asking questions about the cod, since it was not what I expected(I thought it would be dried salt cod) as to how long it would last in the refrigerator, and suggestions as to preparation, and they NEVER got back to me. I stuck it in the freezer...not sure how to deal with it. Lots of money shelled out for fish I cannt prepare as of yet...

review/summary: Gee, It's Ghee!
review/text: Ghee is the shortening and frying oil of Indian cooking, butter that has been 'clarified' of its proteins and salts. It looks like and feels like soft lard, semi-liquid at room temperature. In comparison to butter, it scorches at a much higher frying-pan heat; thus instead of flavoring food with the typical French "brown butter" taste, it is relatively neutral but allows the essences of spices and seeds to be accentuated. A typical Indian recipe for lentils, for instance, will call for cooking the lentils in one pan and then lacing them with aromatic spices - fenugreek, cardamon, caraway, etc. - fried quickly in ghee.<br /><br />Chefs in big cities like Minneapolis, Seattle, or Sunnyvale will have ghee available in their neighborhood bazaars, along with rose-petal ice cream and fresh naan, but it's gratifying to find that ghee also is marketed on the internet. After all, so many of the computer geeks who keep America fed, informed, and entertained are immigrants from India.<br /><br />If you plan to substitute for ghee in your down-home Indian chow, DON'T use salted butter, olive oil, or soya oil. Canola oil is probably your best hope. Ghee has other uses that might appeal to Americans, by the way: skin-softening; skin scraping in lieu washing with soap, which is what the ancient Romans did; gun-stock polishing (if the British Raj had known the difference between ghee and tallow, they might have averted the Sepoy Mutiny); and, of particular value to Missourians, as a preservative top-layer for 'confit du vautour' and/or Geierp�t&eacute;.

review/summary: my introduction to ghee
review/text: I decided to look for an inexpensive ghee to avoid the time and care needed to make my own. Though the outside of my box had a grease stain, my jar of taped and bubblewrapped ghee was intact. I find this jar to require salt and the texture to be grainy. It has a nice flavor but not the nutty overly buttery flavor I anticipated.

review/summary: Mislabeled and stale.
review/text: First, I happened to be the customer who told them their declared weight was wrong on this product. It used to be listed (here on Amazon as well as on Pamela's own website) as .7 ounce each. In fact, each packet, a single cookie, is .2 ounce or slightly more, so they still don't have it correct. After lengthy email and phone correspondence they sheepishly admitted the error in weight. You could say this is not worth troubling oneself over, but that's more than three times exaggeration, .7 to .2, so the goal of truth in advertising should have straightened them out. (If you order these cookies and have a postal scale, you can weigh them yourself; you won't find them weighing in at .43 ounce, I'm pretty certain.)<br /><br />Second, before I had finished corresponding with the company, I had ordered this product (100 packets of .7 ounce each). I had tried them in the other package they offer, I believe 7 full ounces (now that I think about that, I wish I had weighed that package's contents). Extreme chocolate really did describe the cookie. BUT, these individual packets contain stale, or at least, very, very dry cookies; nothing at all like I'd tried before.<br /><br />Try them if you want, but be prepared to ask Amazon for credit. I did.

review/text: Embarrassing as it is to admit, I am one of those who purchased this item believing it to be for human consumption not canine.  The advertisement above is extremely misleading.  The only clue I found indicating that this was dog food was a statement that say's "perfect" for smaller dogs.  This one statement is VERY easy to overlook if you're looking for ingredients not advertising.<br /><br />Product Review:  It took six weeks for this item to ship.  Do not order if there is a deadline for delivery.<br /><br />This item is extremely hard.  To the point when I tried the first one I wouldn't even throw it outside for the squirrels afraid that the nut training they had done all summer and fall was insufficient preparation to tackling one of these.<br /><br />Once I came on-line and finally realized they were dog food, I did go home and give one to my Golden Retriever.  She enjoyed eating it.  However, 24 hours later she was throwing up and could not eat anything for more than 3 days.  This product is responsible and it is not eligible for refund.<br /><br />All in all other than looking attractive there isn't much to recommend here.

review/summary: Hot "Chocolate"?
review/text: This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The "hot chocolate" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere.

review/summary: Perfectly Fancy!!!
review/text: My 9 year old absolutely loves it!  Of course she is a fancy Nancy fan and whenever I sit down to have my Latte, she feels all grown up to have her fancy hot chocolate with her Mommy.  Love the taste and aromatic coconut scent.  I think its great she loves it and its different, she loves it and that is the most important thing she feels she now has her own special drink like Mommy when we cozy up to hot drink.  I have to find some more as she is upset she has ran out and we were lucky to find this one at Home Goods, now have to see where I can order some.

review/text: I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water.

review/summary: Luck O' the Irish Hot Chocolate Mix
review/text: Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the "cauldron" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of "hot chocolate" per container if you like the "flavor" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.

review/summary: Received WETLANDS Formula As Shown in Photo
review/text: Amazon's photo and main heading both describe TOTW Wetlands (duck quail, turkey), but the written description further down the page is for a different TOTW canned food - High Prairie (bison, lamb, venison).<br /><br />Since the 1-star reviewer said they received the High Prairie bison/lamb/venison instead of the Wetlands duck/quail/turkey, I wasn't sure which 'flavor' Amazon would ship.  They shipped Wetlands as shown in the photo and main heading at the top of the page.<br /><br />The Wetlands formula is crammed with nicely sized meaty chunks from bottom to top of can with a tiny amount of gravy coating the chunks. I mix 1/4 can of this with TOTW dry dog food and feed to my 5 month old puppy.  She loves this food and scarfs down all 3 of her daily feedings.<br /><br />Highly recommend this quality dog food.

review/text: This is the first brand of food we have found that our 10 yr old Westies tolerate well. We use both the wet and dry version of Wetlands, and our boy who has an ultra sensitive tummy, rarely gets sick now, and is finally bulking up a bit. Our girl who suffers with Fall allergies seems improved now that they eat Wetlands exclusively. We did switch to Newman's organic for one month, and symptoms returned in our boy, which proved to us that Wetlands is the best choice for our pups.

review/summary: Not bitter and easy on my stomach!
review/text: We are huge coffee drinkers and drink it every morning and most evenings after dinner.  Years ago I used to drink Starbucks French Roast.  Loved the taste but it just tore my stomach up and it was very acidic. I was hesitant to try another Starbucks but love vanilla flavor so I thought I would give it a try.  If you are used to drinking flavored coffees, you won't taste much vanilla...just a hint.  Very smooth and overall good taste.<br /><br />The ingredients on the side of the package says:  Ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root.  Also on the bag it says, "To preserve that fresh just roasted flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in a cabinet (not the refrigerator) and brew within a week of opening."<br /><br />Overall I liked it.  If you want a coffee with just a hint of flavor, I would recommend this.  However, if you are used to lattes loaded with milk, cream, sugar and other flavorings, you probably won't taste much of a difference between this and unflavored coffee.

review/text: I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't like bitter coffee.  This coffee does not brew very strong, and is also bitter.  I've found this to be true of most arabica blends.  The beans have the aroma of vanilla, but the vanilla flavor was very subtle.  I think this coffee would be okay for someone who doesn't like their coffee very strong.  But, if you like a good, strong cup of coffee, I would avoid this one.

review/text: For me, nobody can beat Dunkin Donuts coffee. But the addition of vanilla can make just about any coffee palatable, and since this had the Starbucks name on it, I figured it was worth a try.<br /><br />But I couldn't really taste the vanilla. Overall, this coffee just didn't impress me as either bad or good. It just sort of sat there. Maybe it has to do with my coffee-making skills, but I don't know why the vanilla flavor wouldn't come through.

review/summary: Gental!
review/text: I was in Baoshan City, Yunnan Province, China last August and had the opportunity to taste the local coffee that they called "Small Bean" coffee.  The flavor was uniquely pleasant and very gentle in taste.  I was wondering if Starbucks would be interested in that kind of coffee.<br /><br />When I received Natural Fusions, I was pleasantly surprised to be brought back to the highlands of Southwestern China that I just got back from.  I don't know where this coffee is from, but I am quite sure it is a similar kind of beans.<br /><br />I am glad that Starbucks doesn't infuse too much extra flavor, in this case vanilla, to overpower the natural taste of this coffee.  If you like the usual bold and strong Starbucks coffee, you might not like this one.<br /><br />But I think this coffee is quite safe for entertaining guests that you don't know what they would like for coffee because it won't turn anyone off by it's fine, gentle, and somewhat classy flavor.<br /><br />Just like drinking green tea, which is always mild, but the joy is in savoring its fine natural quality.

review/summary: Nice complement to my Keurig coffee maker
review/text: I recently acquired a Keurig coffee maker. It has been a good investment. And it includes a doodad that allows one to use something other than specially made "K-cups" (coffee containers explicitly designed for the coffee maker). I had earlier purchased this coffee, thinking to use it in my old Mr. Coffee machine (which never created the kind of taste that I wanted).<br /><br />However, in a Keurig machine, this works pretty well. I am still calibrating how much coffee should go in the container for brewing. One rather odd observation: There is not much vanilla fragrance when one opens the package; there is also not much of a fragrance when it is brewing. But when I drink a cup, the vanilla flavir is there.<br /><br />So, in the end, I find this a nice complement to my Keurig machine. I'm pretty satisfied, although the taste is still not as robust as I would like (but I am still experimenting on how much coffee to use, so this may resolve).

review/summary: Delicate with a hint of vanilla
review/text: To be wholly fair to the product, I feel compelled to disclose that I'm not usually a brewed coffee drinker these days, except for restaurant outings. Having tried about every coffee around at one time or another, I find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1KTUA">Nescafe Clasico Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> suits my personal tastes more than any other. I drink one cup black in the morning and a second in the late afternoon with lots of Half-and-Half.<br /><br />As for this product, it's quite a pleasant coffee with no bitterness whatever. If found it to be especially delicate in ambiance, even though I intentionally brewed it just on the strong side. Had I used this extra amount of coffee with other gourmet brands that I've tried, it certainly would have been much darker and bolder (and in all liklihood, harsh) in taste.<br /><br />I was surprised in regard to the vanilla (a flavoring that I generally like) aspect of the coffee. The aroma of the grounds is pretty significant and I expected a similarly infused flavor in my cup; however, the vanilla came through as little more than a slight nudge. I actually would have preferred a more prevalent vanilla taste had I gone specifically for a vanilla-flavored coffee. But this facet of the blend might represent a positive point for certain other vanilla coffee lovers.<br /><br />Would I personally buy this product? If there were no such thing as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1KTUA">Nescafe Clasico Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> then I could say with some confidence that I would buy some intermittently. I'm limited for health reasons as to the amount of caffeinated coffee I can drink each day so I'm looking for a *plain old roadside diner coffee* experience most of the time -- for brewed coffee that would be either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1X45G">Yuban Original Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1BM16">Maxwell House Original Roast (Medium) Ground Coffee, 11.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, and not a gourmet-type brand. If I were choosing a specific *Starbucks* blend for myself, it would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034L2VUY">Starbucks Christmas Blend 100% Arabica Whole Bean Coffee (1.56 lb. bag)</a> which I slightly prefer over the one under review here.<br /><br />However, I would not hesitate for a moment to serve the Starbucks Vanilla to either casual visitors or dinner guests, especially since the vanilla flavoring is so subtle. This is a quality product which I think many people will much enjoy.

review/text: I drink Starbucks coffee at home each morning.  I like a strong bold cup and therefore usually brew the darker roasts.  I am not a huge fan of flavored creamers but on occaision I will get a vanilla flavored coffee at a bagel shop.  I was excited to see Starbucks new line of flavored coffees because I assumed the quality would be just as good as their regular coffees and that the premium price would provide a genuine good hint of vanilla flavor.  I was deeply dissappointed in the strong artificial vanilla smell and taste when I brewed this coffee.  I couldn't even drink it with my 1/2 & 1/2 in it. It was worse than any gas station flavored coffee or instant vanilla coffee beverage I have tried.  The aftertaste was terrible and I had to throw away the remaining coffee.

review/summary: Starbucks french roast+tsp. vanilla extract= fusions
review/text: I gave this a try, as I enjoy flavored coffee from time to time, and I also enjoy the starbucks brand, especially their darker roasts.  In terms of it's roast, this did not disappoint, so for you milder coffee drinkers, this might be a bit bolder in flavor for you.  That said, the dark roast with the added vanilla flavor didn't seem to fuse so well for me.  Instead of both flavors working harmoniously, it was like dropping a dash of vanilla extract to my french roast in the morning.  One flavor, followed by the vanilla aftertaste.  My local store carries this at 11 oz, and a starbucks typical roast at 12 oz for pretty much the same price.  So we're talking an ounce difference price wise.  The fusions coffee comes only ground, so it doesn't work for the french press users, and I just wasn't impressed.  Not horrible, but not worth coming back for more.

review/summary: Love It!
review/text: I hate flavored coffees for the most part. Not because I dont like a little flavor in my coffee but because most companies use flavored oils and inferior beans and are often very bitter. This caught my eye because the flavors are in their natural form ground with the coffee. I thought I would give it a shot and LOVE it. The coffee alone is a good quality coffee and the suttle vanilla flavor really comes out when you add a small amount of cream and sweetner. It's not my daily coffee but I always look forward to drinking it!
