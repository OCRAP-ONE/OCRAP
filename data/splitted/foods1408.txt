review/summary: I love it
review/text: I first bought ez-sweetz to use when mixing my own nicotine liquid for use in e-cigarettes.  It was recommended to me for that purpose as it keeps its sweetness even when vaporized, and works great for that.<br />Even though I am overweight I had refused given up on using artificial sweeteners in my sweet tea, which I drink at least a quart a day, because before I could always taste the difference, but, since I had it on hand, I did give it a try and could not taste any difference between ez-sweetz and sugar in tea, thus I rate it 5 stars.

review/summary: Human Grade Goodness!
review/text: The main complaint I have against canned dog food is it smells awful, but not Fromm's! My dog loves the chicken and beef flavors. It smells like human canned stew (ie: Campbell's Chunky) and you can actually see shreds of meat, whole peas, carrots, and potatoes. My puppy is extremely picky and I've tried a variety of canned foods from Merrick's to Halo to Taste of the Wild etc and she has refused to even take a single bite of any of those. But when I gave her Fromm's Four Star (not Gold or the other canned ones), she gobbled it up! I've been mixing her Fromm's canned food with some Ziwipeak just so her stool is harder, as one of the major concerns with canned food is soft stool. Yes, Fromm's Four Star canned food is pricier than the other stuff out there, but at least I know I'm feeding my dog quality food.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/20/2012: There was a bad batch in the chicken and beef. I wrote to Fromm's and received a response within 24 hours. They not only offered a refund but also complimentary cases of the product to appease me. It really wasn't necessary because I was already impressed with and satisfied with their prompt and concerned response. It's nice to see a company that actually cares and doesn't lie or get defensive.<br /><br />The only problem is that there's something in the product that my dog can't easily digest and causes her to have bad breath, so we reluctantly switched to another brand. I still stand by the fact it's an outstanding grain-free product and I have recommended it to several friends of mine who have dogs (and their dogs LOVE it).

review/summary: Best dog food EVER!
review/text: Until Fromm dog food, my very picky eater would eat only when he was starving (eating every 2 days). After many tests at the vet, picky eating was the only diagnosis. He eats his 2 meals a day now, and as soon as his bowl hits the floor. I rotate the chicken, beef and pork cans and combine with the Fromm dry dog food. I've tried the duck and the chicken dry, and both work great. I trust Fromm also because of the ingredients list that doesn't take a dictionary to understand. My dog's hair (Peekapoo) is shiny and very, very soft as well. Even though it is expensive, it is the only food my dog enjoys, and my kids don't have a problem with the smells either. Thanks, Fromm!

review/text: This is amazing! What a great value and great taste. I can honestly say since buying it over a year ago that I haven't used table salt once. Even without going into the health benefits of kelp granules as a salt substitute, which are substantial, this is just an excellent seasoning. I sprinkle it on pasta and potatoes directly, I add it in place of salt when baking (depending on the recipe). I can't say enough good things about it.

review/summary: Fantastic smoked salt for many uses
review/text: I bought my first few canisters of this stellar smoked salt from a consolidator/surplus grocery warehouse. If I had known how good it was going to be, I would have bought I all of their shelf stock on the spot. This salt is smokey good, subtle and tasty right from the hand. Made from salt naturally smoked over alder wood, you will find this salt much more mellow and savory than most on the market. It truly stands apart in everyday use as well as a finishing salt on fine dishes. It makes plain cottage cheese on sourdough rye toast sing. Needless to say, I'm pleased to see I can obtain this salt elsewhere as it has gladly become a regular staple in my cupboard, and a welcome gift to friends and family.

review/summary: uh...not sure how I feel about this coffee
review/text: I've been buying the Lavazza Tierra - it's an espresso grind, this is a coarser "drip" type grind. It's got a lighter fruitier more acidic flavor when used in the drip coffee maker (one scoop per cup of coffee on the carafe ie. 8 cups on the side, 8 scoops in the filter) I'm liking it much better as a cold brew coffee, it's very smooth in the cold brew (but then most everything is). I won't be ordering it again, I'm going to try the dark roast, instead. But I got this very very inexpensively, so I'm not that disappointed, I just can't rate it higher for the price, when people want a review of the taste. :)

The sell by date says it doesn't expire until like 2014, but I wonder if maybe they repackaged old stuff? (It only gives a date on the outside box containing the 6 boxes of teas.) I bought several other teas from the Amazon that were fine, just this one.<br /><br />That being said, this is a great tea for people that drink a lot of tea and want a change of pace once and awhile.

review/text: This new Peelu is not like the Peelu I've been missing from my favorite health food store.  I thought maybe the company had gone out of business, since I could not find Peelu anywhere.  The shape, taste, and texture is different.  When they say "peppermint burst" on the package, they mean it.  The peppermint is VERY strong.  Although I still like Peelu better than most gums I've tried, I prefer a more mild peppermint experience.  This peppermint burst will wake up your sinuses.  The chew is stiff, but softens after a while.  Will I order this product again?  Yes.  But, I wish I could trade it for the old Peelu.

The peppermint is pretty strong--makes me sneeze sometimes! All in all, this is pleasant to chew, good for snapping, a fresh blast of flavor. I even like the bottle with 100 pieces in it. (My husband discovered my Peelu and is chewing it now too.) I am ordering another 300 pieces today.<br />July, 1012, and update. The company has reduced the size of the gum from 1.5 grams per piece to 1.25 grams. That's 75 grams less for a bottle of 300 pieces of gum! Believe it or not, the smaller gum makes a difference and I don't enjoy chewing it nearly so much. It is also harder to "snap". Not pleased.

This one DOES and you can taste the bold, rich, strong coffee that I prefer over lighter weaker roasts and especially K cups where you cannot adjust the amount brewed. This one is rich enough that I only drank one strong cup of coffee vs. my usual two in the evening. I loved it and will buy these for my morning coffee on the weekends! Eight O'Clock coffee is one of the least expensive blends that has great flavor and you cannot go wrong with their beans, ground coffee and now the K cups! Enjoy!

I'm a lifetime lover of bean soup and this one tops them all... except for the bean soup my mom made. You can sometimes purchase this soup at your local grocery store, but they usually devote only a small shelf space to it and it usually flies off the shelf. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Yummy rehydrated food, not an oxymoron.
review/text: This meal is something I always look forward to when we're backpacking.  In it there is elbow macaroni, lentils, bits of chili, and cheese (along with other spices).  It takes about 10 minutes to rehydrate after you put the water into it.  The thing I like most about this product is that there is no clean up; you cook it in the bag, then you burn the bag afterwards.<br />The only thing I do not like about this product is that it makes both myself and my tent mate have horrible gas. ("Chili-mac attack")<br />All in all, get it, eat it, enjoy it.

review/text: The chilimac is delicious and quick and easy to prepare.  I have them in the office for lunch - I get some hot water from the coffee maker, pour it in the bag, wait 10 minutes, cut a few inches off the top and there's my lunch in its own bowl.  The chilimac is tasty, organic, quick and no-waste.  Perfect for when you want something complex and not boring at your desk for lunch.<br /><br />If you like the chilimac, you will probably like the buttery herb pasta too.

review/summary: Always good and perfect for caramel apples
review/text: For the last several years my grandsons and I have been making caramel apples--I do the organizing; they do the "creating." Our caramels of choice are Kraft Caramel because they get to do the task of unwrapping the small morsels to start the process and I do the microwaving. They then take over the time-honored tradition of creating the Famous P______ Caramel Apples. It's truly amazing how caramel, M&Ms, and chocolate sprinkles can transform a simple apple into such a splendid 1-lb. marvel of sweet delight. It is so much fun and it is a great kick-off to fall...and one of the precious times I get to be alone with the boys to hear about school and "stuff" before the Holidays invade. And all of this fun almost didn't happen this year!! It seems that Northern California is not among the recipients of Kraft Caramels any longer, so I was delighted that Amazon.com was able to save the day--and our tradition. Thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />One warning, this lot of 12 bags of caramels do NOT come with the sticks needed to make caramel apples. If you plan to use the caramels for apples, be sure to stock up on a bag of sticks from your local crafts store. I wish you all a great time as you create your own "Famous Caramel Apples!"

review/summary: Can't beat Kraft Caramels!
review/text: Some of my favorite mother's recipes call for caramel.  As a kid I remember unwrapping them and stealing a few as my mom would be baking. :)  I love making many of these recipes today and have found it difficult to get my hands on Kraft Caramels.  It's bizarre that they have become a rarity in our area, because they are definitely the best on the market to eat as-is and use in cooking.  They melt nice and creamy but they also harden back to a perfect consistency when cooled.<br /><br />I was very excited to find them on Amazon and for such a great price.  I'm sure over time I'll end up using all 12 bags, that is if I don't end up sharing my fortune with friends. :D  I definitely recommend this product to all great cooks and sweet-caramel-tooth out there!!

review/text: Why is it so many products are getting hard to find in the stores? As long as these have been around, you would think they would be easy to find, but more and more they are becoming "seasonal". Well, once again Amazon to the rescue! I now buy them in packs of 12 because they go QUICK in this household! And the awesome thing about them is since I have celiac disease, this is one of the "sweets" I can have because they are gluten free! I almost did a hand stand when I found that out because I have been eating these since childhood. So needless to say, I am one happy camper and hope I can continue buying these from Amazon!

review/text: I ordered this product on May 2, 2012. It arrived as promised and the box had a date stamped on it of Feb 14, 2012. It did not clarify whether this was the manufacture date or the expiration date. I called Amazon and they found a note related to this product indicating that this is the manufacture date and that the product expires 9 months from manufacture. I suggested they update their product description with this information because it can be confusing otherwise.<br /><br />So, it basically leaves me with 6 months to use this product. I doubt I will through 200 packets by then, but it is still much more convenient than finding another container to put a small amount of ketchup for single serving use.

review/summary: HFCS  = Wont be feeding this to my family
review/text: Go with Simply Heinz Ketchup not these packs its the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS.<br /><br />HFCS.. Here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. Yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while HFCS is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />This framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. HFCS, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />To make HFCS, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. This solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. So while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. Is it any wonder that HFCS is processed differently by the body?

review/summary: Whitish Truffle Oil
review/text: This product is made with Tuber Albidum Pico, or Bianchetti Truffles, which are second-rate, "whitish" truffles from various parts of northern Italy that do not really compare to the rare Tuber Magnatum (White Truffle). This oil has a garlicky scent that may be a bit overpowering to those who do not favor earthen aroma.<br /><br />However, I will say that this product is flavored with real truffles, as I saw no evidence to suggest otherwise, and as we all know most truffle oil on the market are chemically flavored. Even though truffle oil is a finishing oil, I've found that during cooking if you add this particular truffle oil to the dish and let it sit a couple minutes before you finish, it seems to produce a rich flavor and lessen any unpleasing smell. Also, the price is relatively good for such an amount of real truffle oil from Italy, 500 ml.<br /><br />Again this is just my opinion. Those who like black truffle oil may enjoy this oil very much as well. I gave this product 3 stars because I felt it was deceptive to label it white truffle oil, but I would recommend it above all other truffle oils marketed on amazon.

Not exactly environmentally friendly!  It's very easy to make once you get the hang of it & it doesn't take long to get the hang of.  I've read that you don't have to refrigerate it...I haven't had the nerve to take it that far yet.  Kefir is very good for you.  It is reported that it has more beneficial bugs than yogurt!  Plain kefir has a cheesy taste.  I like to describe it has drinking cheese!  I love cheese!  You can sweeten it if you like, but I think that takes away from it's healthy purpose.  It also is a very satisfying drink.  I like to have it with a light breakfast or lunch.  It's a stick to the ribs kind of drink to helps stave off hunger.  Try it!  Your body will thank you, showing it's thanks in the great way it will make you feel!

review/summary: Yogourmet Kefir Starter
review/text: Yogourmet Kefir Starter is not really very good.  It produces a cultured dairy product, but not really kefir.  I tried making six  different batches cultured at different temperatures for either 12, 24, and 36 hours.  It produces an odd tasting culture that is like a thin and runny mixture of buttermilk and yogurt.  While I like both kefir and yogurt, I did not find the taste very pleasant.  I tried it plain, sweetened, and mixed with fruit preserves. My dog, who loves yogurt, sniffed it several times before tasting it, but eventually ate it and seemed to like it fine.<br /><br />This starter will not produce a culture that will grow a colony of "Kefir Grains".  The good news is that I did not have to waste the milk that I cultured with the product, I used the milk culture in place of buttermilk for making biscuits, cornbread, and pancakes. They all tasted great - maybe better than when made with buttermilk.<br /><br />Yogourmet's kefir starter got the best review of the commercial brand I could find, so I gave it a try, since it was also the most reasonably priced.  Unfortunately there does not seem to be many commercial kefir starters that are the real thing.  If it will really make kefir, it is probably called "kefir grains" rather than "kefir starter".  It should also look like bits of cauliflower rather than baker's yeast.

review/text: I bought this to use with goat milk.  First batch (1/2 batch so i didn't waste this expensive milk) was a failure but the milk was ultra-pasteurized so likely wouldn't work.  Tried 2nd batch (1/2 packet) with powdered goat milk and this actually turned out.  Only thing was I only made a 1/2 batch so was gone in 2 days. Excitedly made 3rd batch with powdered goat milk again and whole package of starter, and it did not thicken at all.  It is sour like the other two but not at all thickened like the middle batch.  I will likely try Kefir grains and see how those work out.  Really hate the fritzing with heating and cooling.  I found that to be a royal pain....

review/summary: Fantastic Flavor!
review/text: I'm not a fan of candy but I absolutely love Zotz! I grew up eating them but as an adult rediscovered them one day randomly at a record store check-out counter. Oddly, the lemon, orange and grape flavors are wonderful while the cherry, apple and watermelon flavors suck (no pun intended.) Literally, those last three flavors I couldn't give away and I did try after mistakenly ordering a box filled with them when I meant to order a box of the good ones. I was skeptical when I came across this new blue raspberry flavor but I ended up loving it and will even go so far as to say that it is my favorite of all the flavors. I've even managed to get other non-fans of candy to appreciate Zotz. Unfortunately, these little treats are pricey but they are delicious indeed.

review/text: I am very pleased with my ZOTZ order, this is the 2nd time I have ordered them from AMAZON, although this batch I received are not SO easy to open, the candy sticks to the wrapper and there are some Im finding that are in pieces.<br />Other than that I am loving the BLUE RASBERRY FLAVOR!!!  I have shared many with people that have never had them before, they were my favorite as a child.  thanks.<br /><br />Lori

review/summary: Great Treats For Picky Eater (and picky mom!)
review/text: It's really hard to find healthy treats for my dog.  I have started feeding him an organic, homemade diet to help him with his kidneys and overall health.  He's 15 years old and has become quite picky.  I've looked around a lot for a healthy cookie for him that is crunchy and organic and not too high protein for his weaker kidneys.  These cookies fit the bill.  He loves them and I feel good about giving them to him.  My super picky boy practically snatches these out of my hand!

review/summary: Quality right sized dog treats
review/text: It's hard to find a good quality dog treat at the grocery stores and even most pet stores.  Many have added sugars and artificial ingredients as well as harmful chemicals.  But these have nothing but natural ingredients you can recognize, rice, fruits, vegetables, cheese etc.  Made in Canada, grown in North America.  Natural.  My dogs love them, the treats are not too large as some other brands are, just right for a special treat.

review/text: These organic cookies are my 2 dogs' MOST FAVORITE. The cookies are baked crunchy and flavorful. Because they are small-sized and easy to break with your finger tips, I use those to train my new puppy, too. They are USDA-certified organic. My 18-month Lab/Hound mix has been crazy about these cookies, and now my 3-month Lab/Pit mix puppy has found there's more yummy stuff than the dog food he's fed everyday.<br /><br />I always bring handful of those cookies when we go out for walk. When we visit a dog run, without fail, I become the instant star owner in the park, as all other dogs run toward me, asking for something in my pocket. These cookies must smell so-o-o good to all the dogs, I bet!

review/summary: So great to find a bully stick for sensitive/allergic dogs!
review/text: I was hesitant to order the Canine Caviar Buffalo Stix based on other Amazon reviewers comments about some of their other "stix" products being flimsy or quickly eaten, but I researched this specific item on the Canine Caviar website and these are actually Bison pizzle, unlike other products which may be made from gullet or intestine and are less sturdy. Therefore, these are directly comparable to beef "bully sticks."<br /><br />I was pleased with the case of individually wrapped Buffalo Stix that I received. While the thickness varies, many are quite thick and are obviously of good quality. They do have a distinct odor, as all pizzle does, but it is not terribly overwhelming and seems to drive all my dogs into a frenzy. The price works out to be $1.50 per buffalo stick, which is more than the beef bully sticks, but that seems to be the case with any bison product.<br /><br />Most importantly, my allergy-prone dog absolutely loves them and they last longer than any other chew I have purchased for her (including trachea, scapula cartilage, jerky, etc.) She is a 50-lb medium-intensity chewer, so one stick will keep her completely and totally occupied for over an hour.  She was so engrossed with the last stick I gave her, I was able to take my other dog for a walk and come back to find her still chewing away blithely. (Don't worry, she wasn't unattended with a chew.)<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this product to other people with allergy-prone or picky dogs. I will definitely purchase this product again, especially if there are any special sales or discounts forthcoming. =)

review/summary: Health and Longevity
review/text: My golden retriever, Jake, is 8 years old. I use to buy him the best dog food I could afford (or at least that's what I thought) ... It was grain-free and I would throw in raw meat and sometime fruits and veges. Dogs are meant to be mainly meat eaters, but that can be very costly, so the bulk of the meal was the kibble type food with warm water. Just like us, dogs do need nutritional value in their diet. Unfortunately like us, they don't get proper nutrition or digestion through most of the food out there.<br />  The medical doctors (both people and vets) are not promoting natural whole foods and vitamins. Instead, we are seeing medications dispensed for ailments that can reversed through good nutriton. I truly believe that most of the dog and cat foods out there are doing more harm than good ... cancer, etc,. has become rampant ... these foods are also very poor in moisture and live enzymes that are needed.<br />  After reserching furthur and gaining knowledge from natural vets, I found the best diet to use was the "raw or dehydrated raw" dog food diet. That's when I came across Honest Kitchen ... Jake loves it! His stomach NO longer "gurgles" ... I usually add 2 EFAs (essential fatty acids), a selenium capsule (for added cancer protection), and extra plant derived calcium. When available I will alternate adding raw organic eggs or raw meats.<br />  Please consider this awesome food for your dog or cat ... especially if there are skin, stomach, stool or eating issues ... you might be very surprised at the results!<br />  Warmest wishes for a prosperous and healthy NEW YEAR!

review/summary: A life changer for my Westie!
review/text: My Westie is going on 8 years old. He has always had a sensitive stomach. The vet put him on "special" prescription dog food years ago for it. Even while on this so called "good stuff" I had to break his feedings down to very small amounts about 8 times a day because if I fed him too much of anything at once, he would just throw it all right back up again. He threw up 1 to 3 or 4 times a week no matter how careful I was and regularly woke up with a snurgely stomach that was so loud that you could hear it gurgle and snurgel from across the room. On those mornings, the only thing I could get him to eat for breakfast was plain white rice, which almost always settled his stomach. A couple weeks ago, he ran out of his prescription food and in desperation, I went across the street to our local pet store where I discovered The Honest Kitchen Dog Food. He has been eating this gluten free formula now for 2 weeks. In that time, he has not thrown up or woken up with a snurgely stomach once. I am now able to feed him a heaping bowlful of Honest Kitchen twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening). He LOVES every bite and hasn't thrown it up once. No more breaking down his feedings into little bite fulls 8-10 times a day to prevent him from urping it all right back up again. I only wish I had heard about this stuff a long, long time ago. And I now suspect that my poor sweet puppy has probably suffered all these years from celiac disease, which no vet ever raised as even a remote possibility in spite of the fact that they all knew of his hyper sensitive stomach and the constant throwing up, morning snurgels, etc... (What DO they teach those folks at vet school???) Anyway, long winded review, I know, but hopefully someone with a similar experience of puppy stomach troubles will read it and Honest Kitchen will do the same for their pup as it has for mine. It's been a real life changer for my best friend. :)

It's become a winner to us humans for the quality, whole food ingredients, only food that truly is human grade (with passing USDA guidelines)and the ease of preparing for our sibes.<br /><br />We do also homecook their meals, and they don't exclusively eat THK.  Yet, this is the only "dog food" they will eat, along with whole foods.  We add this into our homecooked recipes for them, serve it on the side or use it as a mix in with other whole foods.

This stuff is great and our two doggies love it.  If you look at the ingredients, you see there is real food in it, albeit a little unappetizing for humans!  We usually mix it with some high quality grain-free dry food.  I've contacted the company directly with some questions and they responded very quickly.  You can tell they are dog people (maybe a few cat people!).  It takes a few extra minutes to prepare, but it's well worth it.

Never once was she "easty westy" in front, never up or down in the rear and didn't have any puppy uglies.  Her chest stayed dropped and she grew proportionately.  She has lovely silky soft coat, wonderful energy.  She was recently spayed and healed very quickly. It is 8 days out and hard to find the incision already!  I attribute this to the healthful food she is eating.<br /><br />In addition to THK I also add raw meat, or raw meaty bones, yogurt and eggs on occasion.<br /><br />I recommend this food to anyone and everyone!

review/summary: Embark was life-changing for my Westie
review/text: I have a 10 year old Westie named Maggie. I rescued her when she was 3 and she came to our family with many health issues including untreated Addison's disease, recurring urinary tract infections, infected paws, excessive drinking, weeping eyes, etc.  I have tried many dog foods to address her allergies that my vet believes may be, at least in part, due to food. None have really helped relieve her symptoms. I lived with constant anxiety that every lick, cough, lethargic attitude, etc would land us at the vet yet again, and that she'd never feel "well".  She was diagnosed with stage II/III mast cell cancer in January and has had 2 surgeries and a course of chemo. When she was diagnosed, I began researching diets for dogs with cancer. Most recommended a grain-free, low carb diet. I switched her to Taste of the Wild. Then it was recalled and I discovered that many dog foods were made in the same plants and could therefore be contaminated even if they had high quality ingredients.  I tried Evo, California Natural, Blue Buffalo, etc. She liked some, wouldn't eat others, and none seemed to make a difference in her health. So I went back online and found a site called thetruthaboutpetfood and purchased a list of recommended dog foods that the site owner researched and deemed high quality. I found The Honest Kitchen brand of dog food and purchased Embark because it was low carb and grain-free. I liked the fact that all of the ingredients were safe and human grade (not that I've ever been tempted to eat it!).  Maggie LOVES it. After several weeks on the food, I noticed positive changes.  Her fur is pure white and not greasy. She has no allergic symptoms.  Her black splotches on her skin are turning pink.  She doesn't excessively drink water.  She's more alert and happier than she's ever been.  Her eyes don't weep which is HUGE. As stated in other reviews, her bowel movements have increased but it's worth it to me to have a health, happy dog.  This is a long way to say that, for Maggie, Embark has been life-changing.
