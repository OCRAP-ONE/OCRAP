review/text: This is the best prime rib rub I've ever used.  Initially found it at Costco in a larger pouch and decided to give it a try.  It was so popular that we ended up having prime rib a couple more times after the holidays and used up the whole pouch.  Went back to Costco but they no longer carried the item.  Thrilled to see it on Amazon.  Having to buy the 6-pack of smaller size pouches was no problem, I gave a couple as gifts to friends and family.

review/summary: Best of the mixes
review/text: When the Chef behind Julia Child, Simone Beck came to America, she went nuts for Macadamias, sorry.  The important thing is that besides loving the texture, which is unique among nuts, she boosts the flavor with a little toasting.  It works.  Furthermore, it is what makes this pancake mix special.<br /><br />I do not use other mixes.  I am happy to do pancakes by hand from scratch.  But it is nice to have on hand.  And I do not always have Macadamia on hand.  Best of all, it travels with me for no fuss away from my familiar kitchen.  The results are superior.  And another thing Simone Beck taught me, these nuts go with maple syrup especially well.  Not cheap, but this is a three pack.

review/text: I prefer belgian type waffles made with this mix.  I've had both waffles and pancakes with the mix and find the macadamia nuts a real treat in a light and fluffy texture.  I bought a can while visiting Hawaii and ate them there (YUM!).  Found them on Amazon and bought up six cans.  Each can makes 4 single or 2 double batches.  Mixes with water, eggs. oil ~ so easy.

review/summary: Almost perfect and almost decadent :)
review/text: For those giving a lower rating because it's not healthy...don't you read the ingredients list? :\  Anyway, I bought this for the high ratings and because I wanted a decadent mix to go with my homemade berry syrup for my kids...and that's what I got.  I don't even follow the recipe, just pour a cup or so in a bowl (double if more people but this is a great amount for 2 people), add an egg, bit of oil and enough milk until it's the consistency I want and they puff up and are great every single time.<br /><br />I have only one, small complaint which also sacrificed a star in my rating:  As another reviewer stated..it did have a few rancid nuts but the majority weren't so we keep happily making and enjoying them.

review/text: This pancake mix tastes good but the construction of the canister is a huge failure.<br />2 out 3 canisters were dented and leaked near the bottom where the metal bottom lid is attached to the round soft carton body.<br />Ditched all of them because of fear for contamination and bugs.<br />The nuts probably had gone stale as well because of the exposure.<br />Won't buy this again because who likes to go through the hassle with returning it and getting your money back.

We have this every couple of months for a special weekend breakfast.  I was so glad to find it on amazon when we couldn't find it at the grocery store.  We make it just like the directions say (except for adding the banana) and the pancakes are all eaten every time!

review/text: This mix has a great taste and I only used water, omiting the egg & oil. My only disappointment is the ingredients and that it is not whole grain but enriched white flour. Hard to beleive anybody still uses bleached flour. It also has sodium aluminum phosphate which I believe is a baking powder, many companies use the non aluminum type because of health concerns.<br />By the way its not made in Hawaii either but would have given this mix a 5 star rating if it was more wholesome.

review/summary: Packaging is better than the tea
review/text: I became a fan of Revoloution Tea a couple of years ago. My favorites are the Earl Grey Lavendar, Golden Chamomile, & White Pomegranite. I have always purchased the boxes containing 16 see-thru tea bags (no strings, no tags). The box of 16 was unavailable, so I bought the 20-count foil wrapped teabags.  Massive disappointment. The amount of tea per bag is far less; the lavender cannot be detected by sight or taste; the strings are too short to be useful; the tags stick better to the tea bags than the string. The packaging is elaborate overkill. I would not purchase this item again. However, I will continue to buy the box of 16.

review/summary: Interesting and enjoyable
review/text: Revolution Earl Grey Lavender Tea is a blend of Ceylon, Darjeeling, and Formosa oolong teas scented with French lavender buds in addition to the usual oil of bergamot.<br /><br />This tea comes in a fine mesh bag that makes a cup of strong tea. There were only a few lavender flowers in the bag but they lent the tea a pronounced lavender flavor and mild lavender scent at the expense of the bergamot, which I had trouble detecting either by smell or taste.<br /><br />Now, I am a big fan of both lavender as a scent and Early Grey tea as a beverage but I don't generally appreciate floral flavorings.  Rose water taffy or rice pudding, lavender risotto, candied violets, anything of that sort always reminds me of soap, and not in a pleasant way.  Even vanilla is not a favorite, although I do enjoy hibiscus.<br /><br />However, the acidity of the tea balances out the floral qualities and after the first few sips, I began to enjoy the flavor and then was able pick up on the lavender scent when sipping.  I now appreciate this interesting, almost exotic taste in the way that citrus-scented Earl Grey tea must have been received when it was first introduced to England.  Definitely worth trying if it sounds interesting to you.  I may even get some food-grade lavender buds and make my own blend.

review/summary: Lavender Revolution!
review/text: This is the best tea I've ever had, I can't recommend it more highly. Nice quality silky bags worthy of the delicious fragrant tea within. The lavender is luscious, and freshly-fragrant. The Earl Grey is equally delicious. I love the nice balance, it's not like drinking flower-water, because the tea is nice and strong and holds its own. You can make at least two cups from each bag. Local availability is dicey, and not packed individually sealed in dispenser box like this, so i get it by the case here. I love the individually-sealed bags in this style of packaging, because it assures each serving will be fresh. Also great for guests.

review/text: I bought these noodles from a store to give them a whirl, and am very happy that I did. Preparation is EASY -- soak them in cool water until soft, then serve according to your recipe's instructions. I have served these in broth as well as in a fried noodles dish. The vermicelli kept its firm texture throughout the cooking process, and friends enjoyed them very much. I am thrilled that Amazon offers these on Subscribe & Save, so I'll definitely order them here when my current supply runs out. A tip if you want to boil these in hot water after they have been pre-soaked: the noodles don't need to be boiled longer than a couple of minutes. They're pretty fine, so give them a quick soak in boiling water and then strain.

review/text: Let me first start off by saying that I am glad I didn't listen to the previous review. I almost didn't buy these because the previous reviewers complaint about the expense/pickles. We absolutely loved these pickles and the price is just fine for gourmet/organic pickles and you get three jars. I can say that the Frances Cowley pickles are my favorite. I got the 3 pack because it offered the different varieties of regular and the spicy. I am not a spicy eater but everyone else in my family loves spicy and they absolutely loved the spicy ones. So the mix of the 3 was perfect for us. We can't wait till we can buy them in the stores where we live.

I am so pleased that I selected the peppermint bark.<br /><br />Don't cram the whole thing in your mouth, chomp away, and swallow.  You'll miss all the good stuff.  Chew slowly . . . the mint and chocolate will mingle (and how I LOVE dark chocolate!) . . . and then there are the little crunches from the itty bitty pieces of peppermint.  Mmmmmm . . . my mouth smiles and goes to heaven.<br /><br />These are perfect.  I plan to get more before the holiday season is over!

I was already a fan of Ghirardelli's chocolates, but this is definitely my favorite for the holidays. Buy a few extra while it's out because peppermint bark season comes but once a year!

review/summary: Great holiday chocolate for a gift or for yourself.
review/text: My girlfriend first introduced me to peppermint bark. I have to admit, I was skeptical at first because when I've eaten peppermint(I guess like a candy cane) in the past, it gets all stuck in my teeth and takes forever to get out. Well, Ghirardelli has fixed all that. The peppermint pieces are so small, it's not a problem to eat them. The chocolate/peppermint ratio is also perfect. You can taste each part and it just melts in your mouth. I highly recommend picking up a bag of these.

review/text: these are a little bigger than the standard mint - they're about the same size as an Altoid but shaped like ovals.  The flavor is really strong and chocolaty with a bitter chocolate aftertaste (rather pleasant if you like the aftertaste of dark or semi-dark chocolate.)<br /><br />the tin is a little clunky - a hinged-top tin - but is kinda cute in an old-fashioned sort of way.

review/summary: Tasty but Not Buzzy
review/text: I originally purchased these caffeinated mints for a 13-hour driving trip.  They taste more minty than chocolaty.  While driving I need to take three at once in order to feel a slight kick later on.  They have found another use on campus for not-so-interesting classes.  For that situation one keeps me entertained enough to not doze off just because I become focused on eating something.<br /><br />Overall I do not find these to be effective enough to justify another purchase.

review/summary: SPINACH EATERS, THEY ARE
review/text: My kitties are SPINACH EATERS, THEY ARE! And they love this Purina Pro Plan Chicken, Pasta (little balls of Pasta) and Spinach...little Spinach leaves are seen here and there. My cats like this well enough that they will eat it on an every other day basis. It isn't SO GREAT that they will eat it every day, day in and day out. But, if it is on a rotation where they get it every two or three days, then they will eat it and lap it all up. I do not mind rotating the food to keep them happy. So far, it has just been a matter of figuring out what they will eat and how often then will eat it. Then, with Amazon's wonderful Subscribe and Save capability, I just order and have items shipped every one, three, four or six months. I have finally found enough foods that I am able to order these and just sit back and watch them roll in!<br />Some of the kitty favs are:1, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TAD0B6">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Turkey and Cheddar Cheese Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>2.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFN2O">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food (Indoor Care), Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>(THIS SALMON IS AN EVERY DAY FOOD). 3.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KK4KI">Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys for Cats, Florentine Collection with Garden Greens, 12-Count (Pack of 2)</a> 4.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1W8WI">Tiki Cat Puka Puka Luau Chicken in Chicken Consomme (12/2.8oz Cans)</a>5.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00513J4PS">Fussie Cat Premium Chicken with Vegetables & Brown Rice - 24 - 2.82-oz.

IT HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME TO FIGURE THESE OUT. My kitties like many of the Pro Plan foods, and also really like the Fussie Cat offerings which are new to us!<br />So, my kitties, say Thank you for reading all this. Hope it will help you find things your kitty will like too. My cats are big lovers of the "Chicken" offerings. They Do like this Chicken, Pasta and Spinah meal! So say: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty!

I ordered before Christmas and did not receive the product until the very end of December.<br />I just now was able to start using the "soapwort" a week ago. Otherwise, I would have had this review up a lot sooner.<br />There was absolutely no sudsing from these roots. They just made my creation smell like musty dirt, but gave no amount of sudsing.<br />I tried to rub a few root pieces in my hand with water to see if there would be sudsing, and no. I tried soaking the roots overnight in cold water and looked for suds in the morning - none. I boiled the water, added the roots and steeped overnight. Nothing.<br />This was a huge rip-off. This was my first purchase from this company, Kismet Kreations. I wish I had purchased things before and had good results so I had something better to say, but this is what I've gotten on my first purchase, and if things are not made right, it will be my last from them.

(Five ***** for addiction)<br /><br />You don't even need to visualize the Austrian Alps to have that feeling of being poured into a hammock. With International Coffees there is the advantage of NO FUSS preparation, NO CLEAN-UP, AND an 'indulgent' hint of cinnamon. HOWEVER, make sure you are purchasing the regular /NOT/ "sugarFree" - - because the latter CLUMPS; there is no other word for the dismaying change. With the "sugarFree" tin you are paying the same for far fewer ounces, too!!<br /><br />Actually, the indulgence tastes mighty like SUGAR, but<br />REVIEWER mcHAIKU hints (tongue-in-cheek): "You will enjoy the taste more if you DON'T read the List of Ingredients!"

review/summary: love it
review/text: I have been drinking Cafe Vienna for about 30 years. I have tried the other flavors made by International Coffee's and always come back to Cafe Vienna. I drink 3-5 cups a day. I have a hard time even drinking regular coffee or tea. I know it's addictive, but this is my one vice. During the holiday season, I warm up Eggnog and put Cafe Vienna in it and it's just as good as what you get at Starbucks.

review/summary: I too want the SUGAR FREE Cafe Vienna BACK PLEASE!
review/text: I love the CAFE VIENNA...the regular is great...but the SUGAR FREE is my favorite.  I cannot find it anywhere...and when looking on-line it doesn't look like they are making it anymore.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that I imagine most all of these type of drinks tend to be purchased and drunk more by women than men...and women tend to want the sugar free varieties of these indulgences!  I just found a long lost can stuck in my closet at work and it made my day!  It is also difficult to even find the Cafe Vienna regular in the stores.  Only the Suisse Mocha and French vanilla are available sugar free...and they are both thick, heavy and TOO SWEET.  Please bring back a range of sugar free varieties...at least on-line ... such as the Chai latte, Orange Caffe, Cafe Vienna of course, and how about that PUMPKIN Spice TOO!

review/summary: Cafe Vienna is the flavor that I like but they used to have Kahlua Cafe.
review/text: I must have gotten started on drinking the GFIC's about 12 years ago.  I really love the coffee and I have it almost every morning. They used to have a flavor called Kahlua Cafe that was absolutely fabulous but they discontinued it for some reason?  So Cafe Vienna is almost as good and it's the only flavor of GFIC that I really like now.  I have tried the others but they are just not as good.  Recently I tried Irish Cr&egrave;me and it was a very light frothy Cappuccino drink with an Irishy taste.  And you only get 5.82 ounces of it in a can because the powder is so light and airy.  But I like Cafe Vienna better.  And I tried Vanilla Caramel Latt&eacute; but it was very sickly sweet and only slightly drinkable.  I can get Cafe Vienna at the Target store for $3.34 per can but they were completely sold out yesterday on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2010.  So I hope to go back next week because I am down to my last can.

review/text: I grew up with Ludens menthol cough drops. Gradually, they fell out of favor in the stores and have become impossible to find. Too bad. They are wonderful! The menthol in them is cooling and soothing, and the absence of other "ingredients" is relieving. If I wanted eucalyptus, I'd choose any of a thousand other cough drops, but I don't want it. I will not start a winter season without having a stash of these cough drops on hand.

review/summary: Delicious tea
review/text: I'm drinking a cup right now! I started drinking it while visiting a friend in Ireland, mainly because he didn't have coffee. Soon I was craving it! I brought home a box when I flew back, and I was searching for more on the web when I found this.<br /><br />It's got a nice mellow flavor and I suspect it's got a pretty high caffiene content compared with the sweet tea we normally drink cold in Georgia. I feel like I've had my coffee after a cup of this.<br /><br />I drink it with a little milk and sugar, and it's just great.<br /><br />UPDATE: A few years later I had persisted in my belief that this is the best tea, worth special ordering. Then we got some Tetley's British Blend from the local store and did a blind taste test. Turns out I can't tell the difference. I still like Lyons just fine, but I don't think I'll special order it. Also, I learned not to be a snob. :)

review/text: These are the chips I grew up on. My mother swore other brands tasted fake, plastic-like or chalky. I have to agree. Over the years I have tried the pricier brands, the cheaper brands, and the "do it yourself" kinds, this one takes the cake. Nestle has always been, and will probably always be, my go to brand of chocolate chips. My only complaint is that they don't make the mini-semisweet chips in 72 ounces of pure chocolate heaven.
