review/summary: Blue Buffalo Weight Control Dog Food
review/text: Blue Buffalo is excellent dog food.  If you compare ingredients with the top Grocery Store brands, you find that premium foods like Blue Buffalo provide quality nutrition, where brands like Purina are full of filler and cancer causing by products.  You can buy those brands cheap, but for anyone that loves their dog, that is a betrayal.  Go to the compare sites and see what is in your brand of dog food.

review/summary: Problems
review/text: Second Bag of the product and my 10 year Lab is still experiencing problems with diarrhea.  We switched to Blue Buffalo Weight Control because our Chocolate Lab was starting to put on weight with Pro Plan Large Breed.  Seems to like eating the food but on his daily walks he has to stop 3 to 4 times from his normal on stop with the dropping always remaining consistent.  The Vet informed us this is a common problem with this product.<br /><br />Maybe just his system but problem corrected days after changing his food only.

review/summary: Blue Buffalo Weight Control Formula Dry Dog Food
review/text: I switched my two Yorkies over to this food because one of them is a little too heavy.  They both love the food, and didn't have any problem switching over from the regular Blue Buffalo formula.  The kibble size is larger than the small breed formulas, but they don't seem to have any problems with it.  One thing to keep in mind is that this formula has more fiber, so your dogs may defecate more frequently/have an increased amount.

review/summary: Would not recommend, Have carpet cleaner on hand
review/text: I have a German Shepherd and a American bull mix. I decided to switch from Taste of the Wild dog food to this Blue Buffalo weight management. My American bulldog mix was getting overweight and i wanted to help her shed a few pounds using this food since the TOTW is pretty high in fat.<br />  The countless positive reviews on petsmart and mostly good on amazon had me sold. I really wish i had tried a different food now. I noticed both dogs stool was a little soft when i was gradually changing them over. Which i didn't think much of. Once i completely switched them over, it was probably the first night i was awoken to one of my dogs having terrible diarrhea on my carpet. (which is a lovely aroma to wake up to) She also threw up a couple times that day and the next as well. So i took her to the vet and everything was normal, the vet gave her some meds just in case it was a stomach bug. The next day my Shepherd starting having the same terrible diarrhea and went in the house. The food is the only thing that has changed with my dogs so i really have no doubt it is what has caused all of the problems. I'm going to discontinue using this food immediately and probably go back to the TOTW. I would use this food with caution!

review/summary: Don't use Blue Buffalo :(
review/text: October 8, 2010. The Blue Buffalo Company of Wilton, Connecticut has announced a dog food recall of certain batches of some of its popular products due to potentially toxic levels of vitamin D.<br /><br />My dog got extremely sick, and was very upset to hear of this.  Only thing that changed with his diet/life was blue buffalo.  I literally almost lost my dog last week and had to have in surgery because his gallbladder was about to explode.  He quit eating completely, was throwing up, diarrhea, and took him to the vet to realize his liver was swollen and gallbladder had to come out.  It's sad to think you pay good money for dog food and you still could be feeding him poison.  I don't know how I will every trust dog food products anymore.  Please make sure there is no recalls on food you are feeding your dog.

review/summary: Buffalo Worst Dog Food ever! Product is toxic and is being recalled! Both of my dogs got extremely sick thanks to this food!
review/text: First of all, the "gain control" formula is a true joke and has a very deceiving label!!!! One of my dogs gained more than 20 pounds in less than 6 months!!!!!! After 6 months, he could no longer hold the food down as he started vomiting the food and have watery diarrhea 4 to 5 times a day and he would start shaking because he could not hold the food in.  We were so concerned that we took him right away to the vet and vet requested us to change his diet immediately.  We did and his diarrhea stopped right away.  Prior to giving him this food, he was healthy and then coincidentally, he started to have major health problems.<br /><br />Furthermore, we got him a companion dog in excellent health condition who was used to eating mainly dry food and we gave her some of this food and to determine whether this food just had an impact (or negative allergic reaction) on our first dog and whether she would be affected or not.  Sure enough, same first day she ate her first bowl of this Buffalo brand food, she had diarrhea and she even woke us up at 2am the first night because she could not hold it anymore. She had diarrhea 6 times in just 24 hours.  A side note on this dog, she has a strong stomach because prior to adopting her, the previous owners told us she eats just about anything from fruits, vegetables, different dry foods and her stomach does not get upset.<br /><br />After all this nightmare and realizing there is no quality at this Buffalo corporation,  we now have started to give them real organic food made by us since we could no longer trust these dog food companies and our older dog has immediately lost the weight he gained thanks to that disgusting, toxic and cheap food. If you have ever watch the movie "Food Inc" and have realized what food is available for human beings, just imagine what type of food these dog food Corporations are selling to our dogs (babies)!<br /><br />Now meal time with our home made food is their favorite time of the day, they absolutely love it and start jumping up and down something that never happened with any type of dry food.  Today to our surprise, we found out that THIS PRODUCT IS BEING RECALL FOR CONTAINING TOXIC INGREDIENTS. We are shocked that by giving them this Buffalo food, we were putting in great danger the lives of our beloved dogs.  If you really love your dog and he/she is truly part of your family, make him/her their own food to protect their health and life. Is really easy to make and does not take that much time.  There are books in Amazon that guides you through the food dogs should and should not eat. Now our dogs eat real chicken, brown rice, veggies, and a spoon of organic multi-vitamin which we mix it all together when serving.  This will not only make them happier, healthier, stronger, but also increase their lifespan.<br /><br />The info below will show you some of the reality and suffering of those who have fed their dogs with Buffalo food:<br /><br />truthaboutpetfood com /articles/more-worrisome-news-on-blue-buffalo-dog-food.html

review/summary: This brand is awful
review/text: I had to come here and review this product because I saw the reviews and had to let people know the truth. All the other people who reviewed this product are the people who are selling the product. A friend of mine works for this "company" and gave me some free samples of this product because i like energy drinks and this was an all natural/healthy energy drink. Well this drink is a joke. I had 5 different kinds including this one, and they all tasted awful. They gave me absolutely no energy at all. After i had drank the peach tea one(or whatever tea flavor one it was), i fell asleep.<br /><br />listen, if you are into healthy energy drinks because you dont want the chemicals and extra sugar, thats fine, but you are going to want something that tastes good and at leasts gives you the extra energy you want, which this product does not have.<br /><br />I really cant think of a "healthy" energy to recommend just because most have sugar or the ones that are sugar-free have some kind of chemical in it that makes it that way. I did used to get FRS a lot, i didnt mind the taste and they gave me a nice little boost, but it started to get alittle pricey.<br /><br />Just stay away from this XS brand and company, they dont sell quality.

review/text: I have bought Ragusas on many occasions all over the world.  They have always been sublime.  The ones I bought here in the states, however, were bad.  I think they were old stock (There was no expiration date on the boxes) or  Camille Bloch is making a different product for the US market.  I know that Cadbury licensed its chocolate to Hershey's in the US.  Hershey's has made that product into vomit.  It would not surprise me if Camille Bloch is trying to do the same thing by tweaking its recipe in order to appeal to the US market. Big mistake.  I will not buy Ragusa's here in the US again.  I will pick them up next time I am in Geneva for the real thing.

review/text: I ordered a 12-pack of Ragusa Swiss chocolates to surprise my wife (who is Swiss) with her favorite treat. Unfortunately the chocolates were rancid when we received them, they had a white film on the outer chocolate surface, indicating the chocolates were way past their prime. I should have returned them and requested a refund, however I am opting to post this review as a warning to others instead. Returning the items would have been too much of hassle, especially since we could only assess the quality of the chocolates by trying them. I would never buy from this seller again, and I do not recommend their products. They are obviously not rotating their merchandise often enough, their chocolate is quite stale.

review/text: I am absolutely in love with this peanut sauce. It's the best off-the-shelf peanut sauce I've ever tried, and I've tried a good number of them.<br /><br />This is not a sweet sauce, though.  It has a good, sharp spiciness to it without being overpowering. I will often use it to marinade chicken and beef for a few hours before grilling satay.  The meat comes out flavorful, with a nice kick to it. What's left in the bottle can be used as a dipping sauce.  Sometimes I will also put out a little dish of the sweeter, coconut-based peanut sauce for dipping as well. The tastes seem to mix well.

Cover, bake at 350 degrees for one hour and you're set.  We serve this with rice and broccoli and use the sauce as a "gravy" on the whole plate of food.<br /><br />The sauce is a smooth, spicy peanut sauce with a sesame undertone that is just fabulous.  It is the best one we've tried, and you could add a little water or coconut milk, but it is about the "heat" of medium salsa, not super hot.  You're gonna love it!

Then I got frustrated when the market was out of stock more than it was in stock. Sometimes I was without for a time - horrors - I can no longer live without it! Then I found it on Amazon. What a relief. I get it at the market when I can because it's cheaper there. This sauce is amazing. I put it on many things from tomato slices to chicken to rice, you name it. I've never found a product I liked this much and I never seem to tire of it. Highly recommended.

Very strong peanut flavor and very spicy.  I like spice so beware if you can not tolerate spicy food, this may be too much (although adding coconut milk tames it a bit).<br /><br />Overall great sauce.

review/summary: The cereal that started a legacy.
review/text: Brought to us by cereal giant General Mills, Golden Grahams is a delectable, yet simple, cereal that inspired such General Mills products as Cinnamon Toast Crunch and French Toast Crunch. Golden Graham squares are relatively the same size as other square cereals, though the pieces tend to be thinner and crunchier than those of Golden Grahams' aforementioned cousins. The taste is basic but delicious, utilizing a honey and cinnamon mixture that is highly addictive. I recall with much fondness eating half a box of these every Saturday as a kid, restraining myself from finishing the entire box only so I would have some left for Sunday.<br /><br />Though taste is obviously the most important feature of any cereal, its ability to hold up against the penetrating and destructive power of milk is a close second. It is my pleasure to tell you that Golden Grahams hold up commendably. Though they lose their crunch fairly quickly, they remain in one piece and retain all of their flavor even after many minutes in the bowl. Furthermore, Golden Grahams has a bonus feature one might not expect: it can be eaten dry with bare hands without fear of getting one's fingers (overly) sticky or tracking sugar-coating all over the house afterwards (I am glaring at you, Cinnamon Toast Crunch).<br /><br />But how healthy is Golden Grahams, you ask. Will my child be safe eating Golden Grahams? I'm really not the guy to ask. I will tell you right now that I am not concerned with this information, nor is it my job to type up all the fine print on the side of the box regarding how many calories each serving contains and how many vitamins are present in each cereal to include it in my review. All you need to know is that Golden Grahams is a healthy option and details regarding potential lethal dosage exist at the General Mills website.<br /><br />The only other area of interest to cereal eaters I have yet to cover is the state of the milk left over after complete annihilation of every Graham in the bowl. Unfortunately, it's also the only area in which this cereal is lacking. The leftover milk is quite average and definitely nothing to get worked up about. However, the fact remains: Golden Grahams is a hell of a breakfast cereal, so go classic. Go Golden Grahams.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Most kids' cereals are too sugary and/or chemical-tasting, but Golden Grahams is a classic cereal that I have been enjoying for a long time. It's hard to not enjoy the sweet taste of honey and graham mixed together, and as far as staying crunchy in milk, it does get soggy after a while, but if you limit your portion size or use small bowls and eat two small bowls instead of one big one, the cereal stays crunchy to the last bite.

review/summary: Mafalde - rare and wonderful
review/text: First of all, I must sing the praises of Amazon's customer service. My shipment arrived a day early (!) when I was out of town, and was inadvertantly left at a wrong address. When I contacted Amazon about this issue, the representative asked me if I wanted a refund or a  replacement. When I opted for a replacement, shipping was upgraded to Saturday delivery. I am EXTREMELY SATISFIED with the service I receive from this outstanding company.<br /><br />re. the product itself: I know that there are people who think macaroni is macaroni so what's the big deal? However, this product is of superior quality because of tooth and texture of the cooked pasta. Also, the shape (flat,long and narrow - abt. 1/2 in.)is perfect for a quick skillet lasagna.

review/text: I am a fan of Umeboshi plums.  Of all the brands I've tried, this one is one of the best.  (I don't suppose I need to convince you how good the plums are if you are looking at purchasing a 16 ounce jar of them!)  I also love ordering anything from Gold Mine as they ship quickly and offer some of the best quality grocery items to be found.

review/summary: Ohsawa Umeboshi Plums
review/text: I know very little about Umeboshi Plums. First exposed to them in a Japanese Medicine book, praising them for their ability to de-acidify the body, I began trying to learn more about them ever since, but living in the "country", knowledge and availability was scarce to nill.<br /><br />I finally decided to give it another try, and found this product on Amazon.com, and so decided to order them. I'm so glad I did. Firstly, they arrived promptly and very well packed, even with a discount coupon toward future purchases (which will come in handy - I'll be back for more). This is a highest quality product, from a first-class company.<br /><br />When I first tasted them - bliss. They are salty, tart, sweet, and wonderful, subtly retaining the original flavor of the plum. My first taste was had by simply popping one in my mouth whole, and I still like them that way. After having finished sucking and chewing all of the fruit from the pit, I like opening the pit with a nut cracker, and enjoying the meat inside - it's absolutely delicious.<br /><br />As for medicinal properties, I can't say. They do have a soothing effect, and my PH has gone up. Whether or not this is from the plums, though, doesn't change a thing. I love them, and will enjoy them for many years to come.

review/summary: Disappointed Fond Memory
review/text: I had the opportunity to try these Licorice Chips many years ago thru a friend returning from Italty who shared these treats with our work group. At first we all thought they were bitter and not the true Licorice we expected. Shortly we all began to appreciate these little "Hockey Pucks" and they became a favorite to all of us.<br />After a reunion of sorts with our old work group these Licorice treats were mentioned and a quest to find these treats was started. I found them on Amazon and placed my order promptly. After all were notifed of my find we all quickly shared the order and expected that special unique flavorful treat.<br /><br />We all were very disappointed these chips, although the same brand chips, weren't the same. They were very all very stale (white powder residue) on all the chips and didn't have that sharp Licorice edge.<br /><br />I will not place any other orders with this vendor, and will find another source who appreciates the importance of fresh quality Licorice and these great little Hockey Pucks.

review/text: My Italian son-in-law remembers these candies from his childhood, but he has a difficult time finding them.  Once when he had obtained some, he gave some to my husband. My husband loves the licorice in this candy, and says the hint of menthol is just enough and so refreshing.  He was disappointed when he had no more. I was thrilled to be able to purchase this item. The candies are very small, and one pound is a lot -- more than enough for the two of them to enjoy for quite awhile.

review/text: One of the things I wanted to see more of a selection of in the supermarket was chinese restaurant style sauces...they're simply the best:)Luckily the brand called 'House of Tsang' came out with a wide selection of sauces geared towards asian style meals and one I was thoroughly impressed with was thier classic stir-fry sauce.I must say it's a big improvement over Kikkoman's,In my opinion the House of Tsang is bigger on taste and backs off on the overly salty taste I get from Kikkoman's...Enjoy :)

review/summary: My all-'round favorite stir fry sauce ...
review/text: I love stir fries!  It's easy to put together a meal for one in a hurry, and you know what you're getting.  I discovered the House of Tsang stir fry sauces several years ago, and got hooked on them.  Then I moved, and the local stores around here don't carry this brand.<br /><br />So, I was *thrilled* to find it here on Amazon.  I've been using some other brands, but they just don't have the depth of flavor I get from House of Tsang.  The other brands are more expensive, too: up to $8.00/bottle at the store.<br /><br />This is a basic stir-fry sauce: not spicy, but with that slightly sweet / soy sauce / nutty sesame flavor, with hints of ginger and garlic.  I've used it so far with beef, chicken, shrimp, and pork, and it works well with all of those.  I usually use either frozen stir-fry veggies, or get a "stir fry mix" from the fresh produce aisle.  My tools of choice are a small flat-bottom wok on an induction burner.  In about 10 minutes, I have a meal.<br /><br />Good stuff, this.

review/summary: Good substitute if you can't find dark soy sauce
review/text: I'm just starting to get into Asian cooking and haven't been able to find any dark soy sauce locally. ("Regular" soy sauce is considered light soy sauce; dark soy sauce is used for cooking instead of flavoring and is much less salty.)<br /><br />I was looking at a bottle of this at the grocery store and noticed the following description: "The traditional Cantonese flavor. Distinctively rich and aromatic. A classic blend of dark soy sauce and tantalizing spices. Warm, savory and satisfying."<br /><br />Dark soy sauce: bingo!<br /><br />This has improved my fried rice so much that I'm already on my second bottle in just a couple weeks. I just add it to the pan until the rice looks brown enough to suit me. It still doesn't really taste "Chinese" because I don't have a wok yet and much of the trademark flavor of Chinese food is imparted by the high cooking temperature, but it's very good all the same.<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows: Soy sauce (water, soybeans, wheat, salt, caramel color), sherry wine, sugar, water, vinegar, modified cornstarch, cottonseed oil, sesame seed oil, salt, dried garlic, hydrolyzed wheat and soy protein, dried onions, xanthan gum, natural flavor, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, and sodium benzoate (preservative).<br /><br />Also, the bottle says to refrigerate after opening.<br /><br />I live in a rural area and can still find this locally for less than $4.00 per bottle, so the price here seems quite high. It's a good sauce for stir-frying, though, so don't hesitate to buy either here or elsewhere if you can afford the price.

review/text: This Donut House Blend is a light roast coffee. It is not bitter & has a mild flavor.  I brew this in an 8oz cup & find it in the "not too light, but not bold" category.  It works well with a splash of milk.<br /><br />I would categorize this blend in the breakfast coffee category - coffee that you sip during breakfast that will not compete with your food for flavor.  It also works well as an afternoon "pick me up" coffee.<br /><br />If you are looking for a mild blend with no bitterness, check out this blend.

Emeril's is superior - truly robust, full and velvety without any hint of a burned, smokey or earthy taste whatsoever, but has a terrific depth and complexity.  Donut House falls short of being an 'extra bold' coffee and is more a medium bodied blend.

To me it is awful! No flavor at all and hardly any color. I normally buy bold flavors/variants and pump the 10oz mug size. I had to lower this one to 8oz to not totally wash it out. I was very hopeful but just forcing my way through the batch. I'm hoping, because of the other reviews that I got a bad batch. So take my review with a grain of salt but I've been using K-Cups for years.

They're all different.<br /><br />This has a smooth/mild flavor.  The coffee taste isn't strong (on either 10oz or 8oz settings, the flavor just gets more "intense") and it's actually kind of nice for a later evening cup of coffee.  But, of the 3 Donut brands, I prefer it the least.

review/text: I ordered light roast coffee and was sent one box of light roast and one box of extra bold.  I didn't notice the error until I had used a couple of the extra bold pods.  Way too strong for me and I am very disappointed.  The light roast was really good.

review/summary: Bitter like a lot of Keurig brews...
review/text: I love the ease of use and speed of the Keurig brewer and the variety of K-cups promised a lot but we have found that most of the coffees are bitter - this one included.<br /><br />I am no coffee "expert" - I don't frequent fancy cafe's and pay top dollar for the best espresso - I just like a nice smooth medium bodied coffee.<br /><br />Keurig suggested I try the flavored brews as they are lighter but I'm not after French Vanilla or Butterscotch - I just want coffee... Maybe I have just lost the plot and coffee always tasted like this I just never took the time to taste it...

review/summary: Great Bold Smooth Kup of Coffee
review/text: This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee.  Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.  This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of.

review/summary: Very Light
review/text: I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the "light roast" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup. Even using two k-cups didn't help much. It's way too light for my tastes; glad I didn't buy the box of 88 at Costco.<br /><br />So, if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee, you'd like this. The flavor is good. But, k-cups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me.<br /><br />Amazon did ship fast and had a good price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Some reviews here don't seem to understand the terms being used.<br /><br />"Light Roast" is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted. Light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times, but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor.  It does produce a `lighter' cup of coffee.<br /><br />"Extra Bold" is a term Keurig/Green Mountain uses to describe a K-cup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal K-cups.  More coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee. The strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew.<br /><br />You can have a "light roast" coffee in an "Extra Bold" K-cup, but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I like a medium roast; a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I get my K-cups either at Amazon (used to be the cheapest) or Costco (is the cheapest). The obvious problem with Costco is the selection, maybe 2 or 3 kinds to choose from. That is why I still buy from amazon occasionally, real nice selection to choose from.  I have had my Keurig for about a year and have tried many different kinds of coffee from most of the companies out there. I found the coffee shop brand at Costco and this has become one of my favorites and was my daily cup. If you have ever shopped at Costco you know that things come and go a lot. That was the case with my donut shop yesterday. IT WAS GONE!! Replaced with donut "house". I figured for .42 a cup I would give it a try. I am not disappointed at all. It is just as good as the donut shop I used to drink. Perhaps ever so slightly less strong, but an excellent cup of coffee, and cant beat the price at Costco. The only thing that is a little confusing on Amazon is the price?? That is really high. Anyway. If you are a donut shop drinker you will love the donut house every bit as much. Don't hesitate to buy it...but make sure you check the price. Great price available form Costco....this week

review/summary: Drinkable, but rather bland, not full-bodied, will not buy again
review/text: I have been a Keurig user for several years, have one at home and one in my office. For at least 4 years I have been using the Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups, been very happy with them. Recently I saw the Donut House flavor offered at my local warehouse club and it piqued my interest, problem is that the warehouse box contains 80 K-cups, didn't want to buy 80 of something I may not like. So, I picked up an 18-count box at my local Walmart, I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Starbucks coffee's, I think they are too strong, too bold, too bitter. I like a flavorful, medium roast but full-bodied cup of coffee. The Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups fit this bill, whenever I would make a cup at my office, everyone would comment, "Wow, that smells so good!", it tasted just as good.<br /><br />I tried the Donut House coffee this morning, no inviting aroma when brewing, very bland in taste, I don't know how they get away with calling this "Bold". It says right on the box, "light roast", I don't know how a "light roast" can be called "Bold"? I was expecting a very full-bodied flavor, but without a bitter after-taste. Well, there was no after-taste, no taste period, just very bland!<br /><br />FYI, I usually use 16 oz. "to go" cups when brewing K-cups, I use 2 K-cups per 16 oz. cup, I brew the first K-cup on the middle button (8 oz. setting), the the second K-cup on the lowest setting (I think it is 6.5 oz. setting), this allows room for a teaspoon of sugar and some half and half to a golden color. I have been doing this for years with my Columbian K-cups and always get a great cup of coffee, did the same with the Donut House blend, drinkable, but not remarkable in any way. I will be sticking with my Columbian Fair Trade blend that never fails me.<br /><br />I will use the remainder of my Donut House K-cups, but I will not buy them again.

review/summary: The only decaf coffee my husband has ever liked
review/text: My husband is a very picky coffee drinker. He actually uses a peculator and brews his coffee on the stove most days (from 8 O'Clock fresh ground beans). He produces outstanding coffee, but it takes a lot of time and energy on a work morning for me. I love the Keurig he purchased me for Christmas. He has never found decaf beans he likes, and even in Starbucks or other coffee houses, hates decaf. He actually likes this decaf a lot. It is our favorite k cup thus far.

review/summary: Pretty delish!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Keurig cups, so I ended up picking a box of this up at Sam's Club the other day to bring to work. (If you have a membership already, this is cheaper there. If not, then this is probably the better deal unless you absolutely want a membership to those types of stores.) It was worth the purchase, in my opinion.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this was pretty nice. I was a little worried about whether or not the cup would be too watery due to the type of machine we use at work (it has a water reservoir that it draws from rather than the one I have at home, where you add your own water), but this brewed up nicely. It was a little mild tasting, so if you're more partial to teas since coffee tastes too harsh then this will be a good alternative. If you're the type that likes the darker roasts, then you'll want to skip this one. (Although be aware that the lighter the roast, the more caffeine the bean has! The darker it is, the longer it's roasted and the more caffeine is roasted out!)<br /><br />I'm fairly happy with this product and I'm pretty psyched that you get so many per box. The smaller boxes are good for individual use, but for larger crowds? You have to buy in bulk just to save money, otherwise you'll go broke.

Other reviewers state it's cheaper at Costco and Sams, and that's true if they have it in stock but at my local Sams Club its hit or miss on what they have in stock at any given timeframe. So to know you can come here and order is a great option.

While I was happy when DD recently introduced their own K-Cup varieties, the only place you can get them is in DD stores.<br /><br />Donut House clearly gets the popularity of DD's freshly brewed coffee, which is richly flavored without being overpowered. They tapped into that need with their Light Roast version, which has has much wider availability that the venerable DD store brand.<br /><br />Check prices in brick and mortar stores (especially big box/club stores), where you might be able to do a little better (IF they have it in stock).<br /><br />This is by far the favorite K-cup choice in our house, which never goes a day without drinking coffee.

review/summary: Donut House Coffee
review/text: The regular Donut House coffee is great. It is a light blend, like Dunkin Donuts. The flavored version though, cinnamon roll, was terrible.

review/summary: The Best Old-Fashioned Coffee Shop Cup of Coffee!
review/text: .<br /><br />Donut House blend is my favorite K-cup.<br /><br />It's a tried and true consistent cup of just about the best old-fashioned American coffee shop coffee you've ever had.<br /><br />Big thank you to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for perfecting this classic cup.<br /><br />(If you're Costco member, this is one of the K-cup blends that my local Costco warehouse stocks in bulk cases of 108 for less than 45 cents a K cup.)

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: This is one of the better K-cups.  I usually don't like bold coffee, but it takes a bold k-cup for me to get a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: "Best If Used By" Date
review/text: When I received the coffee, the "best if used by" date was less than a month from the date of when I received it.  I am not really happy with the almost "expired" date.  This is not the case with other vendors that I purchased K-cups from.

review/summary: great product, poor delivery
review/text: The coffee is excellent and I am a repeat buyer.  Problem this time was with the UPS delivery.  They left the box in front of my garage door in the middle of the driveway. Because of this odd delivery location, my wife ran over the box when she backed out of the garage and did not see the box.  we lost half of the cups.  Thius is the third time I have written about this matter to Amazon with no results.  Hopefully someone will respond to me.<br /><br />fred santaniello
