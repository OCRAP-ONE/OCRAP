review/summary: A Nice, Refreshing Alternative... And It's Natural
review/text: Amazon sent me an entire case of Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice in Blackberry, so I decided to pass it out to my co-workers and elicit their opinions as well.<br /><br />It is nice to see a readily available product made with all natural flavors and no refined sugar. It tastes good and would make a nice addition to a picnic or lunch outside, providing a nice, mellow drink to go along with a sandwich or salad.<br /><br />I was honestly expecting, and hoping for, more of a punch of blackberry soda. It tastes a little like a blackberry tea, a little light in flavor. But the flavor is nice.<br /><br />It also bothers me a little that an all natural soda would be 'fortified'. Yes, with vitamins, but if something is going to be all natural, leave it alone and don't add things you wouldn't normally find there.<br /><br />I first became aware of the Izze brand through their bottled soft drinks, which I believe are also all natural and use no refined sugar. The difference between those and these new cans seems to be the size and the addition of the vitamins. Other than that, I think it is probably the same product.<br /><br />My co-workers seemed to like the taste, but I got the sense they weren't blown away. I don't think this would convert Coke or Pepsi drinkers.<br /><br />I would buy it again, because it provides a nice, lighter alternative to something like Coke or Pepsi.

review/summary: Wonderful taste!
review/text: This is like the perfect thirst quencher when you're tired of soda, but you'd like something with a little fizz. It's the right balance of juice taste, fizziness, and content: the 8-ounce or so can really DOES an incredible job of getting rid of your thirst.<br /><br />I tried the clementine and the blackberry. The latter is just amazing! Not too sweet, not too tart, just perfect! The clementine I liked slightly less (it was a little too tart for me), but it was still very good nonetheless. The added vitamins and natural contents are just bonuses to the amazing taste.<br /><br />The only reason this isn't a five-star review is because of the calorie count. This beverage would be perfect if only for that!<br /><br />Highly recommend (esp. the blackberry!)

review/summary: Izze it good?  Absolutely!
review/text: Although I found this product to be not as fizzy or filling as a soda, my children (ages 9 and 12) absolutely loved Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice in Blackberry.  My son thought it tasted like a less sweet version of Clearly Canadian and my daughter thought it tasted like "fizzy grape juice" and was "totally awesome."<br /><br />I allowed my children to take a can to school to drink with their lunches, instead of juice boxes, and they were thrilled.  They even took some for their friends, who proclaimed Izze the best non-soda fizzy drink around.  Granted, I would not allow them to take this drink everyday, but as a particular treat, it's healthier than most juice boxes, kool aid, soda, and a whole lot more fun to drink than warm cafeteria milk.<br /><br />At 8.4 ounces, there's just enough in a can to quench any thirst.  The slender can makes it easy to slip into a bag.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: I'm afraid this review is destined to be boring in its straightforwardness. This is a lovely, refreshing beverage with a fresh fruit taste. It's not overly sweet. Everyone in my family loves the stuff, and that's that.<br /><br />My ten-year old has noticed that the non-standard-sized cans (they're somewhat thinner than regular 12oz soda cans) tip over a bit too easily for kids; that's really the only complaint we can come up with.

review/summary: Very Well-Crafted Beverage
review/text: I jumped at the chance to review this product because it's right up my alley: a sweet, carbonated soft drink that doesn't contain HFCS (this line is sweetened with grape juice concentrate, hence it's not kosher). I chose the blackberry on the basis of its being a flavor that's not yet ubiquitous, and I wasn't disappointed.<br />This strikes me as more appropriate for adults than children because the all-natural flavor is tart and a bit dry. It's not terribly sweet and is very refreshing. The carbonation level isn't very high and the bubbles are small, which seems appropriate for a drink of this type. The cans only contain 8.4 ounces, but this is more of a sipper than a quaffer anyway. I often put away rather large quantities of soda, especially when it's washing down a meal, but I don't feel the urge to do so with this (which is no doubt for the best). A little satisfies quite nicely.<br />I thought, after the first can, that I detected an aftertaste but I think this was due to its not having been cold enough--make sure that it's very well chilled. One serving contains 90 calories, so it's not appropriate for those who are watching their weight. It's Vitamin C enhanced, but makes no claim to be healthful (which it undoubtedly isn't). However, it has more going for it than the vast majority of soft drinks on the market due to its being an all-juice product, and it really is delicious, plus IZZE partners with a charitable organization. Bottom line: this is one I'd actually spend money on, it's that good.

review/summary: I Can't Get Enough!
review/text: It took me about one week to gulp down 24 cans of Izze's Blackberry juice. I absolutely love this product!  I was a fan of the bottled version, and the cans have reaffirmed my love for it.  Truth be told, I have yet to try any other flavors.  Having spent the past week only drinking the blackberry flavored ones, I can say with confidence that I'd probably love the other flavors too.  The blackberry taste is not too sweet, as one would probably expect from fruit-flavored juices.  The only criticism I have is the size of the can: 8.4 ounces isn't enough!  (I usually gulped down 2 cans at once.) I would love to see a jumbo size version.  It surprised me that the drink is fortified with vitamin C, B6 and Niacin - I'll take it though.  Bottom line: this drink is so good and so refreshing.  It's the perfect refreshment for any occasion.  I highly recommend!

review/summary: Refreshing Break from Syrupy Soda
review/text: This is a slightly sweet drink that will leave you wishing it had a bit more flavor.  While pleasant enough, you will probably find yourself wishing it had a bit more fruity kick to it; it's only slightly more flavorful than seltzer-water.<br /><br />On the other hand, the lack of powerful flavor probably means that you won't feel cravings to keep drinking and drinking and drinking more of the drink.

review/summary: Naturally Refreshing!
review/text: This is a delightful sparkling juice that is naturally refreshing. The lightly-carbonated drink has a lovely scent and color, courtesy of the blackberry juice. The portion is just right to make 1 glassful, and at 90 calories is a nice alternative to a regular, high calorie soda.<br /><br />There is no added sugar; all the flavor and calories come from the blackberry juice itself. I didn't think it was overly sweet, but my husband did.<br /><br />Now this isn't what I would call fruit juice. It's flavored water, and very nicely flavored as well! But for people (like me) who prefer their water to be 0 calories, 90 calories per serving may be too much, which is why I rated it only 4 stars.

review/summary: Fizzy and Refreshing...
review/text: I have had many different kinds of sparkling juice drinks, most of them too sweet or not fruity enough.  Rarely can they reach the balance of sweetness and fruitniness perfectly.<br /><br />  Admittedly, this is not the first time I tried Izze, but it has been a long time.  Ininitially, when I tried the Blackberry this time, it was very bland tasting.  It tasted a lot like Mineral water with juice essence in it.  It was barely sweet, and I am sure I could've made something taste better had I grabbed a bottle of mineral water and a can of juice...  But, I of course, gave it another try and it tasted much much better the second go around!  It tasted refreshing and fruity, and maybe a little bitter, but bitter in a good way.  The nice thing about this juice is that it is like drinking soda without the sugar hangover.  It doesn't make you feel dirty after you drink it, it is quite refreshing.<br /><br />  If you don't mind the cost, and you are looking for an alternative to soda, I would try Izze.  The blackberry is very good, a nice crisp blackberry taste with apple and pear undertones, it is worth the money.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/summary: Moderation in all things
review/text: The Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice (Blackberry) was a very pleasant surprise for me.  I had a few preconceptions which turned out to be misconceptions.  However, if the drink had turned out the way I was expecting, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />The first surprise to me was the carbonation, or lack thereof.  When the writing on the can says sparkling, they're speaking the truth.  This is much less fizzy than, say, a can of Coke or Pepsi.  And for a fruit drink, that's a good thing.  The sparkling does not draw away from the taste of the liquid.<br /><br />The other nice surprise was the taste of the blackberry fruit.  It's a more subtle flavor that I had expected.  It's not overly sweet, yet it has a strong enough flavor.  It's crisp and refreshing.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to this beverage is not the drink itself, but the container it comes in.  The can is only 8.4 fluid ounces.  This makes it a better size for children (the lack of artificial junk is also a benefit for the little ones).  However, speaking as a person who is somewhat larger than the average child, I would not have complained if the cans had been the standard 12 fluid ounce size.<br /><br />This is a moderate, yet extremely nice beverage.  It's moderate in flavor, moderate in carbonation and moderate in size.  The fact that it's natural, has no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, etc. is a very welcome bonus.

review/summary: A good faith Blackberry flavor. Not easy to do!
review/text: I love blackberries and blackberry flavor. It is a very tricky taste to impart as I have found in my candy making/baking/ice cream making efforts. It is so easy for blackberry flavor to end up just sweet or overpowered by the manufacturing process.<br /><br />I feel like the Izze blackberry drink does a very respectable job in producing a true blackberry flavor. The white grape juice does produce a somewhat jarring "top note" that lingers after the blackberry taste is gone. However, I have to give the company major credit for not using artifical flavoring.<br /><br />I'm not one to drink my calories so I see this product as an occasional indulgence with a tiny squirt of vitamins. I did find it very refreshing after mowing the lawn. I happen to like the size of the can a lot and it fits into my lunch bag with ease.<br /><br />I'd be very tempted to buy this again, calories and all.

review/summary: NATURAL JUICE WITH SPARKLING WATER IS A WINNER!
review/text: Four HEALTHFUL Stars!! Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice is a great tasting all natural juice, which is bursting with antioxidants, with a splash of sparkling water to add a little carbonation to the flavor. It is fortified with Vitamin C and B6.  Low sodium, caffein-free, and 70% fruit juice, it's actually a mixture of apple, white grape, blackberry, lemon, and raspberry juices from concentrate, not just blackberry juice. I like the taste and the fact that the sugar in the juice is all natural. The taste, physical color, and smell is somewhat like a wine cooler (without the alcohol, of course) and could be poured into a wine glass at a party as an alternative for non-drinkers. The sugar content is high, so allowances should be made in that respect. I would buy this product especially for the antioxidants in the juice and the different taste that it presents. Highly Recommended. Four SPARKLING Stars!!

I also don't drink very many soft drinks anymore and try to avoid high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />Anyway, I wasn't sure what to expect what I tried this Izze drink. I had hoped for a stronger Blackberry taste, but find the different fruits blend  together well for a slightly sweet taste that would be good to drink inbetween meals or maybe with lunch.

review/text: While I wouldn't classify this drink as "health food," it is an excellent alternative to soda for both kids and adults.  You won't find high fructose corn syrup here, but you will find real fruit juices, lightly carbonated and delicious.  My children love it and the 8 ounce cans are perfect for sack lunches.

Best of all this product consists of all natural flavors and ingredients, including 70% fruit juice from concentrate.

review/summary: Soda Wars
review/text: I like soda pop. Diet Coke used to be my favorite but the extreme carbonation has made me look elsewhere for a soda to enjoy. Diet coke would hurt my mouth and actually take the breath away from my vocal cords unless I poured out some of the bottle and shook out the carbonation.<br /><br />I have tried many sodas over the years, and found the Diet Mountain Dew has a good taste and not as much carbonation as Diet Coke. Of course it also has a boat load of caffeine.<br /><br />I did try some of the "natural" soda's available from Fresh Fields and other high end grocery stores but found most of them too expensive.<br /><br />I am not too concerned with all natural ingredients or calories and I have found 12 once cans of Orangina to be my favorite so far.<br /><br />IZZE Fortified would have to rank a close 2nd for me.<br /><br />A case of 24 will cost you about $1 a can or so once the shipping is figured in. Note that the cans are 8.4 ounces and not the familiar 12 once size of a coke can.<br /><br />IZZE is pretty proud of itself and that cockiness is deserved from the case I sampled.<br /><br />From the can:<br /><br />PURE FRUIT JUICE & SPARKLING WATER FORTIFIED WITH VITAMINS. NATURALLY FLAVORED JUICE BEVERAGE FROM CONCENTRATE.<br /><br />NO REFINED SUGARS, NO CAFFEINE, NO PRESERVATIVES, 70% PURE FRUIT JUICE WITH A SPLASH OF SPARKLING WATER AND FORTIFIED WITH VITAMINS.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: PURE JUICE MADE FROM WHITE GRAPE, APPLE, BLACKEBERRY, LEMON AND RASPBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES, SPARKLING WATER, CITRIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVOR, RED GRAPE JUICE CONCENTRATE (COLOR), ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C) NIACINAMIDE, PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN B6).<br /><br />One can is one serving and contains 90 calories.<br /><br />I had a case of the Sparkling Blackberry but it tasted more like grape soda to me. None the less I found it tasty and the carbonation level was just about right. If I were concerned with the calories (I am not) I could see cutting it with some water.<br /><br />I feel good about recommending this product to Amazonians.

review/summary: Nice sparkling drink that isn't overly sweet
review/text: I like to pay attention to the glycemic index of the foods and drinks I consume (basically determines how fast the sugars in something are converted to glucose in the body) so was pleased to find this line of sparkling fruit drinks that doesn't have any refined sugars added. Sparkling juice is one of my favorite "sweet" drinks and these compare very nicely to others I had tried, including some fairly premium brands. If you are like most of us that have to watch our waists, this is a great alternative to soda, and is fortified with some extra vitamins as well (C, B6 and Niacin). The size of the can I find a more reasonable size for me to drink in a single sitting...and some of the flavors make great ice cream sodas as well! The apple is my favorite of the ones I have tried, with a surprisingly complex apple flavor much like a sparkling apple juice I get from a local craft show vendor. The blackberry was very nice as well, not quite as sweet as the apple, but very refreshing (and makes a great ice cream soda!) Compared to other premium sparkling juices, the price per ounce of Izze is very reasonable as well. Definitely recommended.

review/summary: A Superior Beverage - a review of Blackberry Izze
review/text: The Blackberry Izze is a good product.  My whole family -- with the exception of my 6 y.o. son who doesn't like fizzy beverages of any kind-- thought it was delicious and refreshing.<br /><br />As a mom I like the fact that there isn't any corn syrup or disguised sugar in any of the Izze beverages.  This means that I can offer Izze to my daughter and her friends without guilt.  They aren't downing sugary colas and they don't miss them!<br /><br />The only downside I can think of is that the product is somewhat acidic, so those with ulcers, or who have acid sensitive stomachs, might want to moderate their consumption.<br /><br />Conclusions:::  Juice, fizzy water, and vitamins makes this a superior drink.  It's not dietetic, but I have to tell you that after coming in from yard work, it is very refreshing.

review/summary: Several flavors are too sweet to drink uncut.
review/text: It's nice to see this product made with all-natural ingredients, with proceeds going to benefit educational institutions around the world.  The blackberry flavor is quite tasty although to all of us in the family it's more of a generic sweet fruit, not specifically blackberry-flavored.  But it's too sweet.  I tried cutting it with tap water but of course that flattens it (but makes it less sweet and more enjoyable); then I tried cutting it with plain seltzer water, and that was fine.  It retained the fizz.  But we probably won't buy this product (or any of the other Izze flavors) because when you want to grab a can of something to drink, you don't want to have to fiddle with mixers.<br /><br />Unfortunately the grapefruit flavor is the same.  There's a nuance of grapefruit flavor to it, but it's mostly just a too-sweet drink that makes our teeth feel funny.<br /><br />We also tried the Clementine flavor which is good in an unobtrusive, not-too-sweet way.  It's not as overly sweet as the blackberry, but still, this has as much sugar as a can of Coke, and Coke is much cheaper, comes in larger cans, and more easy to come by.  I was hoping this product would be less caloric, but it isn't.  So, this is not going to be a repeat purchase for us.

review/summary: Refreshing, not too sweet, convenient size
review/text: This is a review of Izze's "Sparkling Blakberry".<br /><br />When I was younger I would often try mixing fruit juice with seltzer.  We always had a lot of both in our refrigerator.  The problem for me in my 'mixology' experiments was finding a balance between the juice and the seltzer. If I used too much juice the drink tasted flat; if I didn't use enough juice the mix would not be sweet enough.  It was fun to experiment but, like roulette, the odds of finding a drink that was consistently satisfying were against me.<br /><br />Izze has taken the guess work of of the process and the result is a drink that is thirst-quenching and 'fizzy' but not too sweet.  The Blackberry I tried out does have a nice fruity taste. It is not pure blackberry but a blend that also contains grappe, apple, lemon and rasberry juice. Despite the fact that this is a blend, the result does have a berry-ish flavor.<br /><br />On the plus side: I do like carbonated beverages, including soda and I liked the fact that this drink had the carbonation I like but did not have as much suger (20g) as that found in a regular non-diet soda. I prefer a less-sweet drink with sugar to a sweeter drink with artificial sweeteners and the Izze Blackberry filled the bill.  I also liked the fact that the cans are 8.4 ounces.  I don't like jumbo drinks, I like just enough to quench my thirst.  This relatively small size works for me. I also prefer the metal packaging to glass. This cools quicker in the refrigerator and stays cool longer.<br /><br />On the down side: My only negative is the one negative side-effect of the drinks being only 8.4 ounces.  The can is narrower than your average soda can and it just does not travel well in the cup-holder of my car. The cup holder seems designed for your standards soda can or cup of coffeee and the Izze can bumped around a lot while I drove.<br /><br />All in all I very much enjoyed this Izze product. It was tasty wihtout being too sweet, the balanace between the jucie and sparkling water is a good one, and it quenched my thirst.

review/text: I am not a fan of the fruit-flavored sparkling waters sold by so many soda and water bottlers. If you are going to carbonate a beverage, why not really carbonate it instead of the halfway carbonation of sparkling water? Izze has the light "fizz" of those sparkling waters, but the flavor is much better because it is 70% juice.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the taste. I keep a supply in the refrigerator and, although I do not drink it every day, I find that it is a nice change from water or soda. The 8.4 oz. cans are just right, and they chill quickly. As others have pointed out, the flavor is much better cold than at room temperature.<br /><br />So would I buy it again? Maybe. My husband and I both thought it was "OK." We liked drinking it, but would not go out of our way to buy more. And we do not feel any sense of urgency to try other flavors.<br /><br />If you are looking for a somewhat healthier soda replacement, Izze may be a good choice. For juice, I will stick to plain, old-fashioned juice.

review/summary: Very Tasty - But..
review/text: These fruit snacks are very tasty and considering that they are made up of 66% juice this is great.  However....I noticed that the front of the package states that they are made from "American Grown Fruit"  and when you flip the package over it states "Made responsibly in China".  ?????  This is very disappointing.  It is difficult to think that fruit is grown in the US, shipped all the way to China, made into fruit snacks, and shipped all the way back to the US.

review/summary: Excellent Afternoon Office Snack
review/text: When it's right around the end of the day at the office and I need a little pick-me-up, I usually try to eat a piece of fruit to get the natural sugar rush.  When fruit is not available, I reach for these fruit nuggets and they do the trick.  They totally satisfy my need for something sweet and I don't get the nasty sugar crash that I normally get from candy.  They come in the perfect amount and yield only 50 calories.  My local grocery store caries the 24-pk variety box and they last quite a while.  They can sometimes be hard to find, so I'm really glad to see that I can order them from Amazon.

review/summary: Great treat - better than candy, too!
review/text: This is perhaps the coolest product I've ever stumbled on. I bought two boxes at Target locally, and assumed the purple ones were grape (they're blueberry, but they taste grape-y if you're not sure about the blueberry flavoring). I used to buy Skittles or some other fruit flavored candy late afternoon, and was looking for an alternatve - these are better, taste, serving size and health wise. Small nuggets of INTENSE flavor - more than three or four is too much to have at once (gives you that 'cheeks sucked in sour' feeling) - and even though each packet is only less than an ounce, you'll feel surprisingly satisfied at the end. 66% juice, gluten free, kosher, vegan, low calorie - they can make any mom happy (except those who are paranoid about HFCS - there is some, but not much). Unsurprisingly, considering these are made by a company known for it's orange juice, the orange are by far the best, but the others are great too. No apple in this assortment, though. As my mom always says - Try them, you'll LOVE them!

review/summary: Fun snack that really satisfies your sweet tooth!
review/text: The Box contained 12 individual cartons, each with approximately 6-10 pouches of candy.  Each pouch was a different flavor and contains a small handful of delicious chewable candy.<br /><br />You can't help yourself from chewing it all into one extremely sweet mass.  It does however stick to your teeth rather easily, but it will come off with just a little effort of your tongue.<br /><br />Even though there was an assortment of flavors including Blueberry, Orange and Strawberry, It doesn't included Apple!!!  The Apple flavor of this candy is their best flavor of all. My entire family agrees.<br /><br />Overall though, It will take a while for me to work through this entire box, enjoying myself the entire way!<br /><br />Apparently they are made from 66% fruit juice with lots of vitamin C and loads of Sugar. (That just makes it better for me - yeay!)<br /><br />I recommend this candy to anyone who is looking for something very sweet other than Hard Candy or Chocolates.

They are harder than just chewy, although they taste good and I was hoping they were also good for you. I think they are mostly glorified candy. They only come in small packets which is wasteful packaging. So, they are good, but you can get tired of them quickly.<br />I won't buy them again.

review/summary: Best Cat food out there!
review/text: I had spent that past 7 years of my cat's life feeding her $5 Purina cat food. She was coughing up hairballs, shedding like all her hair would fall out, her coat wasn't very shiny, her playfulness was minimal and I thought "well, she isn't a kitten anymore". Until I happened across a pet food supply store that explained to me that not all cat food is created equal. I had no idea that most cat foods were corn based, that cats really shouldn't eat corn, and that the special hairball senior vitality cat food really doesn't do anything. So after taking note of the brands this store carried, I did some research and was absolutely floored by the care and science put into Orijen cat food! Visit their website, they have 30 page pdf files explaining each ingredient. So after a year now of my cat eating Orijen 6 Fish she has not had one hairball, she attacks my toes at night, her fur and figure looks like a model cat and she loves her food! She is picky eater when it comes to kibble, but she can't get enough of this stuff. My only complaint is that it smells to high heaven! Awful, rotting fish, litterbox smell. It smells as soon I open the jar, the first two hours it's in her bowl, and again we she eats it. I tried the original formula, it smells much less, but her coat lost a bit of its luster, so I went back. The smell is worth her health. I 100% recommend that everyone should feed their cat this food.

review/summary: Be nice to your cat
review/text: I switched to this cat food after reading how bad cat food you can buy in the grocery store is for cats, the health problems it can cause. I read the ingredients on the label of the so called premium off the shelf cat food I had been buying and was appalled at what I had been feeding my cats. After apologizing to my cats for the stuff I had been feeding them I switched to this after researching brands on the net. I did it by adding this food to the brand I had been using over time (only a few days), making the mix more Orijen each feeding. (I was concerned about abruptly changing their food). It turns out I didn't need to do that, they took to this food right away. They eat less of it because they are getting better nutrition and as a bonus neither one of my cats has "yarked" up since I switched! My male cat used to eat fast and occassionaly throw it all back up, now he no longer does. The food does not smell fishy to my sensitive nose. The manufacturer recommends freezing it and taking out what you need but I've never done that and have had no problem with it keeping just fine.

review/summary: Somewhat Strange
review/text: I have three cats and currently feeding many cats on streets that were deserted by runaway foreclosed home owners. I have first tried feeding Organix, Spots Stew dried Salmon and Chicken, and ended up with Orijen from the recommendation by a local pet store owner. I have one cat that seems to be very picky. She hated Spot Stew's Salmon dried cat food but loved the dog food version of Salmon. I still can not figure out why. Since it may not be healthy to keep feeding dried dog food, I have decided to buy 6-fish and tried to convert her to hopefully better cat food. Well my picky cat really hated it and even got angry when I tried first with just 6-fish then with mixing of dog food with it. My other two cats ate it reluctantly. After over a week of persistent effort, well my cat got really upset and even gave up eating all together. Feeding dried Chicken food from Orijen solved the problem. So since I have so much leftover of 6-Fish, I have decided to use it to feed hungry cats that visits my house during wee hours. Strangely enough, with exception of 2 out of 10+ different cats, They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I am sure there are cats out there that would love 6-fish. There are also those that don't. It may be impossible to create a cat food that every cats love. Maybe the town I live in may have only strange cats that do not love 6-fish. I don't know. I am not complaining about the quality of ingredients. If what the label states is true and honest, then I will continue purchasing Orijen's product.<br /><br />The other problem I have noticed was that my two other cats started having more discharge from eyes after feeding 6-fish than from other dried cat food. When switched to the raw diet, the problem went away.

review/text: There's no question that this food is high quality. I bought it to transition my kitten off of Royal Canin, which is expensive but lists chicken meal as the first ingredient. Unfortunately, Orijen proved too rich for my cat and the vet recommended Science Diet for sensitive stomachs, which is better, but still not great. I wish that there was a smaller, less expensive trial size of Orijen so that I didn't end up with a half-eaten bag, but it was worth a try.

review/summary: Definitely worth the extra cost in comparision with in-store brands
review/text: Great cat food like the ziplock bag feature to maintain freshness, my cat attacks the bowl as soon as I pour it in. Its got everything from salmon, whitefish, vegetables, fruits, juniper berries, healthy ingredients that you will not find from any of the companies that sell in-store cat food brands, if your worried about the price being too high don't because it beats out Iams, Purina,, 10 out of 10 times. Or any other in-store cat food brand by a mile, mainly cause its unavailable in stores, since it comes from Canada so there's no retail price to put on it, and you really can't put a price on your cats health especially considering with all the corn/meat fillers, with chemicals that are injected in many in-store cat food brands these days, so that's why Im strongly reccomending orijen over in-store cat food brands.

review/summary: THIS IS GLUTEN FREE! Description is for another  product with Hodgson Mill!
review/text: Why the product is listed as having whole wheat flour I don't know!  I hope there is some way for Amazon to be notified and change that. There is another Hodgson Mill's wheat product and hopefully only the description is mixed up.  The ingredients in this mix are as follows:  Sugar, Brown Rice Flour, Cocoa, Tapioca Starch, Cornstarch, Baking Soda, Xanthan Gum, Flake Salt, Baking Powder.  NO WHEAT.  It is thick and they tell you this on the box.  I made this the other day and it is the best gluten free chocolate cake I have ever had.  I also tweaked the recipe a little and used it to make whoopie pies and everyone cannot tell they are gluten free-they tasted like soft Drakes devil dogs and had that consistency, moist smooth and chocolatey(and I added an instant coffee packet). Yes it uses buttermilk, but you can get powdered buttermilk and reconstitute just what you need, so that you don't waste buying a carton and only using a cup just for this mix.  Also, because my family doesn't like almond extract I didn't put it in.

review/summary: The most succulent canned tomatoes
review/text: Muir Glen makes the best canned tomatoes I've tasted. Ripe and firm, they hold their shape better than other canned tomatoes, and the fire-roasted ones have a delicious smoky flavour reminiscent of hot paprika. These are excellent for any recipe requiring that little extra zing.

review/summary: Tastes like plastic
review/text: When I opened the can, I thought the product had a plastic smell. I wondered if the fire roasting made them smell different than I'm used to. I went looking for reviews to see if others had this experience. One reviewer on this site says the cans are lined with plastic and leach BPA. I don't know if that's true, but based on how the tomatoes smell I'm inclined to believe it. They also have a plastic undertone to the taste. I've decided not to use these tomatoes.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Tomato Products
review/text: Muir Glen has the best quality tomato products on the market. They are a bit more expensive than the cheap brands at the grocery stores, but well worth the difference. Since I "subscribe" to regular shipments from Amazon, it is cheaper to have Muir Glen products delivered to my door, than what it costs to buy Muir Glen at the grocery stores. Not many stores carry Muir Glen anyhow, so buying through Amazon is, by far, the best way to get these delicious tomato products.

review/text: i use these to make pizza, pasta sauce, ratatouille, chili, beef stew and a cooked spicy tomato ranchero sauce for beef/cheese enchiladas. the tomatoes have a great added depth from being roasted. whole tomatoes for pizza, i just slice them, lay flat, topped with crumbled oregano/basil like as if i were using fresh. buying whole tomatoes really allows to decided the final texture of the outcome. anyway very versatile ten times better than most canned tomatoes.

review/summary: why bpa?
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: Try this one!
review/text: Make sure you try this one, particularly if you have a fussy eater.  This was a huge surprise for me when he gobbled the stuff down like he'd never eaten before.  He normally doesn't go for the mixed fish varieties but this one is definitely a go.  The grilled varieties in Fancy Feast seem to be a huge hit here and this one is no different.  Can't say enough good about them - they're a higher quality food, you can smell that when you open the can, and they're more protein enriched than all the other cat foods, including Iams which Friskies now owns.  Anyway, highly recommend!

I am truly disappointed. I should have spent 3 more dollars and ordered the real deal from keurig.com.<br />5. I don't know if it is the box or what, but something smells bad. It smells like wet towels out of a smoking lounge, which is not really appetizing.

review/text: I was in whole foods in Seattle Washington and saw this gumbo for sale. Being a Louisiana native, I know what good Gumbo tastes like. I am no fool, I knew if I purchased Gumbo in a jar it would not be nearly as good as homemade Gumbo. I was utterly shocked at how bad it actually was. It had such an overbearing taste (I think it was bay leaves or Okra) that it ruined the entire gumbo. I fed this to 2 others in my household and they had the same thoughts. I never waste food, and I even tried to reheat it and eat it the next day....it promptly went in the trash. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but it was so bad that I had to look it up online and see if others had the same experience!

review/summary: My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky
review/text: Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say "gentle kick", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.

So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.

review/text: I have been on a beef jerky kick lately, and this is one of my new favorites. It starts with the tenderness of the meat. The meat is on the soft side but still has a nice chew to it. It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect. I've tried multiple Sweet Baby Ray products and have yet to be disappointed. Grab a bag or two, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I am a HUGE fan of Suddenly Salad Classic.  In fact, I probably make it 2-3 times a week.  I often add things in like cheese, or sunflower seeds - I've tried it and loved it all.<br /><br />Sooooo, I thought why not try a different flavor?  That was a terrible idea.<br /><br />I should be clear that I am in love with bacon.  I could eat it for nearly any meal.  This tasted like imitation bacon flavored dog food as opposed to a refreshing bacon/ranch blend.  I mean to tell you, it's as if you are eating something that is ransid and synthetic all at the same time.<br /><br />I rarely find any foods I don't like.  I am a gourmet eater, I love all kinds of flavors, textures, etc.  This was hell on earth.<br /><br />I don't understand it.  It's just a pasta salad.  Ranch = safe.  Bacon = safe.  Pasta = safe.  This combination should be......safe.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, or risk your health.  If you are interested in something like this, I suggest the following:<br /><br />Boil 8 cups of water.  Cook one pound of pasta.  Drain, and rinse with cold water.  Blend in 1 to 1.5 cups of ranch dressing.  Mix in chopped up bacon (made in advance).  Then stir in whatever else you want (peas, celery, etc.).<br /><br />As far as Suddenly Salad Classic, that is really refreshing and tasty.  Go for it!!!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This is a really nice, rich tasting maple syrup. Those new to maple syrup should try the B grade because it has more authentic flavor and is thicker than the lighter grades. Goes farther on pancakes and in recipes, too.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.

review/text: Thought I'd take a chance on this, as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades (light amber is best).  Price is beautiful -- grocery store charged as much for two 8-ounce bottles as this whole quart.  Shipping time was amazing -- super saver in 1.5 days -- and yum!  Reminded me that it's been years since I bought a 3-pound box of maple sugar candy...  Time to search again... &lt;grin><br />Forgor to mention -- definitely grade "A" Fancy -- not grade "B" (the cooking grade).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HI556E">Hidden Springs Maple Vermont Maple Syrup, 1 Quart - Fancy Grade - Light Amber</a>

review/text: Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup is excellent!  There isn't anything on the label that states that this is from anywhere else but Vermont...(some syrups that claim to be pure maple syrup also have labels that state that they may be a product of Canada or Vermont).  The price per oz. is about 81 cents and as I use at least one ounce on my waffles, this bottle will last for about 16 servings.  I will be buying this one again!

review/summary: Rich maple flavor, good value
review/text: I ordered the Grade B Hidden Springs Syrup -- Grade B is my favorite for baking.  I love the strong, rich maple flavor.  This is my favorite amongst several maple syrups that I've ordered from Amazon.  Maple syrup is understandably expensive, but this syrup is a good value among its' competitors.

review/text: Tastes great, and it's a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives, even at our local supermarkets.  It's tough to find Grade A medium amber syrup in pints.  I'll probably just keep ordering these a few times a year.

review/text: Living on Guam can at times leave much to be desired. We were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in Wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an Amish farm. I remembered how good it tasted and I remembered I had some Maple syrup ice cream while there, sooooo. I got on line and found this 1/2 gallon, price wasn't bad  (here at a local store a pint of REAL Maple syrup will cost $12.00) and it had free shipping. I had it in a few days, and made the ice cream right away. By the way I also made pancakes and sausage for dinner, and this here Maple syrup was as good if not better than what I had 8 years ago. VERY well packaged, and really fast shipping. Nice bouqet, great light amber color, great job to the cooker. Oh yea, by the way, the ice cream came out wonderfully.

review/text: This maple syrup is delicious and so flavorful -- Did you know grade B maple syrup has so many vitamins and minerals you could almost not feel guilty about having french toast for breakfast. I also try and use maple syrup where I can for sweetener instead of sugar. The company was wonderful about the shipping and the product arrived packaged well and on time! Enjoy.

review/text: This is only the second time I have ever tried grade B maple syrup. I liked this one better than Now Foods grade B. I think it has more maple flavor. I only give it 4 stars because of lack of experience compared to others. I think its priced well and it was shipped well.  I really love it on plain yogurt as well as pancakes and waffles. Would definetly buy again.
