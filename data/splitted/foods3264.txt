review/summary: Expected More
review/text: I had high hopes for this as I like even the powdered hot chocolate mix. It tastes okay, just not good enough to continue to buy. I did make one cup as directed but stirred in a powdered hot chocolate mix and it tasted really good (better than either one individually) I do suggest you try that if you are not impressed with the taste.

review/text: As I write this, we're headed into summer heat. The only reason that's disappointing is it's harder to find an excuse to make this hot chocolate!<br /><br />Since you make it in the Dolce Gusto machine you'd think it has coffee in it, but it does not. It's just a frothy rich hot chocolate. If you're a chocolate fan, you owe it to yourself to check this out.

review/summary: Rich milk chocolate flavor comes at a cost!
review/text: I really wasn't prepared to like this flavor capsule for the Dolce Gusto. Considering I've been underwhelmed with the Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa k-cups for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>, I was not expecting this to be much better.<br /><br />On the contrary, the cocoa is sweet, milky, smooth, and flavorful. But, at 150 calories and 89 cents per serving on Amazon subscribe & save, this is not too much of a bargain. For the occasional cup of cocoa this fits the bill, but if you have children around who like to drink a lot of cocoa and invite their friends over for it, this can get pricey. Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa on the other hand is only 60 calories and 54 cents per serving.

review/text: Of all the Dolcue Gusto flavors, this is the one I like the least. It's not that there's anything wrong with hot chocolate, it's just that you can do a lot better than this attempt. If you like hot cocoa from normal powdered mixes, then this is a slight step up. But it's not creamy enough! I'd recommend just making your own cocoa at home from scratch. You'll be more pleased with the results. This one's not worth 150 calories.<br /><br />2/5

review/summary: The Only Hot Chocolate My Household Will Make From Now On
review/text: The beverage flowing from Dolce Gusto's Chococino pods is a great cup of hot chocolate. I have not had better "instant" hot chocolate. The flavor is comparable to that coming from some of the more expensive packet-based mixes, but with none of the heating, stirring, clumping, and residue at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />What I love about the Dolce Gusto that showed itself well with this beverage is the simplicity & cleanliness. Whenever I make myself hot chocolate, I will inevitably drop powder on the counter or spill all over the cup while I'm stirring. Dolce Gusto is simple, clean, and quick.<br /><br />The cost, however, must be considered. The chococino (like the cappucino  and the latte macchiatto) takes two pods: a milk pod and a flavor pod. At Amazon's current pricing, that makes each beverage just more than one dollar apiece. This is worth it for me compared to the cheaper cost of the mixes because we drink hot chocolate so infrequently. Compared to the cost of Starbucks hot chocolate, this is a bargain. But the cost is certainly not negligible if you drink it often.<br /><br />Chococino will likely be the only hot chocolate made in my house from now on.

review/text: I purchased the Dolce Gusto machine and my first few boxes at Bed Bath and Beyond.  signed up for the subscription and saved a lot. Each cup costs me roughly $1.06 but on amazon its only about 89 cents. These prices are certainly a lot cheaper than Starbucks. Why pay more if you can really save and have them shipped to your door? I love the subscribe & save program and i'm so glad these are a part of it! The chococino is basically a rich, frothy hot chocolate. It is always a hit when we have company over!

review/text: Everyone's tastes are different. With that said, I would definitely recommend trying these first. I tried Nescafe Chococino pods (along with some other flavors) in the machine I bought that uses these pods. Really wanted to like them but they were AWFUL. Bitter, synthetic--like something from a vending machine. The Dolce Gusto espresso/cappuccino/latte maker has been returned to Amazon; unfortunately, the pods are a grocery item so not eligible for return. I have two boxes--50 dollars' worth--of the cappuccino pods sitting in the box they arrived in--feel like I put fifty bucks into my office shredder. Bottom line is, should have tried them before ordering any equipment/pods off the internet. Save your cash--try them first!

review/summary: Mediocre at best...acceptable for the price.
review/text: I started using Amazon groceries to order various healthy snacks directly sent to me in the office.  It has paid off enormously as I am in great shape eating lots of high energy food (low/ no sugar) throughout the day and this lets me a very light lunch.<br /><br />That being said I guess I was expecting more from these when I ordered them off of Amazon groceries.  The price was right but the biggest problem for these is that they are kind of tasteless.  You really need to eat them with something else.  The other major problem is that they come all broken and at best 20% of the crackers are intact.  You really end up eating the box as a "cracker chips".  Also the box has no clasps or folds so there is no way to actually close the thing which isn't exactly a bastion for freshness...<br /><br />Bottom Line:  They are alright and if your expectations are prepared before getting these you might be surprised.

review/summary: Good crackers...bad packaging
review/text: I gave these 3 stars because I really like the flavor of these crackers, but as stated in many of the other reviewers' comments, they don't hold up in shipping, so for the packaging, I would only give them about 1 star.  I actually purchased 18 boxes (3 cases), 6 each of the 3 flavors and I had to open all 18 boxes to just get enough "whole" crackers for my guests (8 people) for Thanksgiving appetizers.  I could only get about 6-8 crackers per box that were not broken literally into crumbs.  I did, however, contact the factory and they were very apologetic and said they will address the problem and offered to send me additional boxes.  Hopefully these will arrive in better condition and they will get the problem resolved, because I would love to keep purchasing these crackers.

review/summary: Tastes Like Ritz Crackers
review/text: I agree with the first reviewer, that they are mostly broken up pieces. Approx 15% may be whole & intact. I also agree that they should have packaged them in a reclosable bag, especially since they are not manufactured with a strong preservative.<br /><br />I had low expectations for them before I took the first bite so I was v-e-r-y pleasantly surprised. They taste just like ritz crackers to me but without all the unhealthy additives & preservatives. The taste may be a little more mild, but it was still distinctly ritz to my taste buds.<br /><br />-On the plus side: Tasty! Multigrain; Not too much salt; Low sugar (2g/srvg); No Hydrogenated oils; Organic; No saturated fat nor trans fat.<br /><br />-On the down side: contains milk & wheat; Only 5oz per box (says 5 servings/bag but it was only 2 servings for me); 80-85% of crackers are broken even in an intact box.<br /><br />Obviously, our taste buds vary so I can't assure anyone they will agree with my verdict. But I personally enjoyed them & will purchase more despite the minuses.<br /><br />Hope that helps

review/text: The good part about this cornmeal is that it is organic - so you can hope there are no GMOs in  your evening polenta. The bad things about it is that a) its texture is too fine for polenta (which is why I purchased it in the first place); and b) it is BITTER. I am not sure if only my batch was bad (I did get 12 packs and I am only making my way through the third), or if it's something related to the type of corn they use, but the result is bitter. Only if I boil it for an hour, which is excessive, is the bitterness somewhat reduced. I will not be buying this brand again.

I am very pleased with the order--and the price--comes out to a little over one dollar for a 5.2oz bag (12 of them in an order). The candy is just soft enough to be chewy but not too soft to be mushy and sticky. It is just sweet enough to be delicoous witohut the sweetness taking over, and the licorice flavor is amazing. I've shared some packages with like-loving friends, and they are all raving about it and now want to order their own batch! Highly recommended.

Looking on Amazon for my favorite sweet, I came across Gustaf's and the reviews convinced me to try them. THANK GOODNESS I did. The very initial taste was that they were ever so slightly different from Venco. However, after working my way through a few bags, that difference is no longer there or evident. These are every bit as good. So much so, I ordered a 2nd dozen only 2 days after receiving the first dozen. They have the right sweetness, chewiness and hardness. Now...if I could only find a Salmiak Passtilen that is like what Venco used to make, I'd be all set!

review/text: Great licorice.  I am German and have been looking for this style of licorice for a very long time.  It has a very different texture and flavor as compared to the American style licorice.  If you have ever ate licorice in Europe and you liked it - this product is it.  A blast of licorice flavor that is smooth and can be eaten almost like hard candy.  And it shipped super fast!  Thank you!

review/summary: Love the Chocolove
review/text: My husband and I love the Chocolove raspberry bar and had never seen this coffee flavor before we came across it recently at a health food store.  It is amazing!  It is mocha to the max, containing tiny bits of ground coffee beans.  The wrapper indicates that each bar is equal to about 3 cups of coffee. The company uses smooth, belgian chocolate that is delish!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would have preferred that the chocolate was fair trade certified, ensuring a fair wage for the chocolate producers and helping to ensure that the bar is slave-labor free (a large problem especially with cocoa beans from the Ivory Coast).

review/summary: big european coffee
review/text: is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it.

I was really expecting the coffee to smell great when it was brewing, but maybe it is to mild.  If you like milder breakfast type coffee or chai tea you will love this coffee.  I added a little light cream and it was very good, be careful with the cream it needs very little.  My first cup I put to much light cream and it overpowered the drink.  I would buy this again, it is something nice to give as a gift or serve to company.

review/summary: Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe
review/text: While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.

The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.

review/text: Well, I wasn't bright when I ordered this coffee and for some reason I thought it came in both single servings and pods. I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill.

review/summary: This Coffee is Not Bad
review/text: This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of "pods" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though.

review/summary: Weak but okay
review/text: Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper.

review/summary: Needs more instruction but we figured it out
review/text: Marley Coffee is an interesting product which comes in a tasteful display box/dispenser, and proves that one can have fresh rich coffee just about anywhere without dedicated coffeemakers or pod machines.<br /><br />Maybe the "One Love" variety is meant for two cups per "single serve" bag, or perhaps one is supposed to do something more than to "Stir It Up" little darlin', as recommended on the box (in homage to the song.)<br /><br />There wasn't instruction on the packaging on how to get the brew right with these large "tea bags" of coffee. The only thing clearly marked was which side of the bag should be faced down in the cup.<br /><br />The coffee has a good taste, but the first bag I tried brewed up so strong it gave me the jitters. Good thing there are 15 individual plastic-sealed bags in the dispenser. My husband fiddled around with them because he likes an occasional cup of joe in the afternoon but doesn't want to brew up a whole pot.<br /><br />I credit him with coming up with the "spoon test" to figure out when the coffee was at the perfect strength. We use a 16 oz. cup because the circumference of the bag is rather wide for our 12 oz, and we pour boiling water over the bag which rises to the top as the cup fills. Then we wait for it to steep. After a couple of minutes, he takes a spoon and starts lowering it into the cup just until the bowl of the spoon is completely immersed. When the brew gets dark enough, the bowl of the spoon disappears except for the edges, and then it's done.<br /><br />It's a quality product, convenient, and can save on electricity, as well as not wasting coffee and good water, or adding pods to the landfill. And it's a really nice way to remember Bob Marley, a man of nature from Jamaica.

review/summary: Not the best Ethiopian coffee I've had, but pretty darn good for a coffee pod
review/text: Executive summary: not as good as a traditional cup of Ethiopian coffee, but definitely the best coffee pod coffee I've ever had.<br /><br />Several years ago I walked into an Ethiopian restaurant for the first time.  The food was good, but the coffee was the best coffee I had ever tasted.  It was rich and dark and so incredibly flavorful.  It didn't pack a killer caffeine punch, which is good, because I drank a whole pot by myself.  I love coffee and drink it daily, and I've never found another coffee that came close, except at another Ethiopian restaurant.  It's my understanding that coffee originated in that region, which may have something to do with it.  (If I'm wrong, sorry--I'm not a historian.)<br /><br />While I looked forward to this coffee, I was pretty sure it wouldn't be as good as the coffee in the restaurants, made in the traditional way.  I was right.  Still, this is the best coffee I've had from a coffee pod.<br /><br />It was rich and dark, as I expected.  The scent that was released when I opened the packet was wonderfully deep and complex.  The first cup, made from the pod, was very good, if a little bland.  The smell while it brewed turned a little unpleasant near the end, for some reason, but it faded quickly and wasn't present in the brewed coffee at all.<br /><br />I took out the coffee press for the second cup, and cut open one of the pods.  (I don't recommend this, since the grind is far too fine for a coffee press.)  The coffee made this way was much richer and more complex, and the scent while it brewed was sweet and tempting.  Two cups of this coffee didn't give me caffeine shakes, so caffeine levels seem about average.<br /><br />If it matters to you, this is Fair Trade Certified coffee and some profits are donated to Kicks For Cause Foundation, which supports youth soccer programs.

review/text: This conveniently-sized pod fight perfectly into my Senseo machine, and brewed up a first-rate cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the recyclable packaging, the wonderful coffee aroma assured me I was in for a treat. The flavor didn't disappoint. Smooth, complex, and rich, with a subtly floral note, this coffee was head and shoulders about my usual Senseo pods, and in my opinion, far superior to the burnt and bitter notes of a certain overpriced but popular coffee chain.<br /><br />A fair trade product that donates funds to a children's soccer charity (rather than turning a blind eye to child labor), Marley Coffee is a morning cup you can enjoy with a clear conscience.<br /><br />Normally, I drink more tea than coffee, so I don't consider myself an expert, but I know what I like, and for me, Marley Coffee was definitely a treat. I received a free sample for review, but I'll definitely be purchasing my next box.

review/text: This coffee comes packaged in individual filter pods, as shown in the product image. I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine. Unlike other pod coffees I've tasted, which are weak and watery, this has a good coffee flavor. A nice medium blend, it has a unique flavor, and isn't bitter/acidic. However, those looking for a dark or super strong jolt should try one of the other roasts. Overall, a good, easy to make, cup of coffee.<br /><br />According to the box, the Marley Coffee company's products are organic, USDA certified, Fair Trade, and child labor free. In addition, some percentage of the profits are donated to children's soccer programs.

review/summary: Marley One Love Organic Coffee
review/text: I have not always been a coffee drinker but have recently begun to enjoy a cup or two per day. Since my son is the only other person her that drinks coffee and he usually drinks the entire pot by himself, I tend to use the store brand or Maxwell House single serve coffee that is used in the same manner as a tea bag. I am not certain that is the intended use for the Marley single serve coffee pods. I don't have a single serve coffee machine although at times I vacillate about buying one, so I'm not sure what the pods for the machines that use them look like. The Marley coffee pods may be intended for use in one of these machines; however the package and the item page do not specify how they are to be used other than single serve. I brewed them in the same way I brew my usual coffee by heating the water in an electric kettle and letting it steep in the cup until I think it has brewed long enough. It seemed to work just fine.<br /><br />As far as the taste, I enjoyed my coffee. It had a somewhat bitter smell but I was happy to find that it did not have a bitter taste. In fact it was fairly smooth tasting. My son also tried a cup and said it was okay. He likes his coffee so strong that most other people can't drink it so I wouldn't go by his opinion. He did mention that he thought it was too expensive. I guess it would be expensive for someone who drinks as much coffee as he drinks. He could finish a box in a couple of days.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />1. This coffee is very tasty and perfect for those who only want one cup at a time.<br />2. This coffee is a good choice for those who prefer organically grown, fair trade coffee.<br />3. This coffee also supports the Kicks for Cause Foundation with partial proceeds going toward youth soccer programs.<br />4. I doubt that I will purchase any of this coffee but that is because I am not a coffee purist and tend to be satisfied with less expensive blends.

review/text: Delicious medium roast coffee made of 100% Arabica beans, grown in Ethiopia by a very conscious company.  This company exists in an area where child labor is prevalent; they however, insist the children of laborers go to school.  That says a lot!<br /><br />The coffee itself is not a blend that will give you a morning jolt, it is a medium blend with berry and floral overtones, which we had a difficult time tasting, but it does have a nice flavor and would be great to serve to guests or for a special occasion.<br /><br />I find it rather difficult to review an item such as this, as taste is so subjective.  However, both my wife and myself find this to be a premium coffee that has a slightly different taste than that which we are familiar. I am not saying that in a negative way, just to let you know that it will be something a bit different.  It is enjoyable and believe it can be well recommended for most coffee drinkers.<br /><br />The company itself must be commended for its treatment of workers, sustainable crops and its contributions to kids organizations in that area.<br /><br />Stir It Up!<br /><br />Ed

review/summary: Ok but I've had better
review/text: Tasted my first 8 ounce cup with the usual amount of sugar. It's fair I guess for a medeum roast coffee but homestly I've had better & I won't be buying any after my 15 count pack runs out. Sorry this one's not a winner as the caffiene is on the weak side however the flavor seems to be good. Unless your not looking for that morning coffee wakeup then I'd pass on this one.

review/summary: Weak coffee
review/text: It's organic, arabica coffee packaged in pods. I was looking forward to great tasting, conveniently packaged coffee. The box contains 15 pods. Though there's plenty of organic ads and blurbs on the box, there was not one line of instruction. I followed the suggestion on the product page here, and used my drip coffee maker with 8oz of water. The coffee was way too weak. I think using half the water amount would work better.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, upscale packaging but lacking in description
review/text: Most attractive and functional packaging (individually foil-sealed pods) but while it wasn't hard to figure out the usage once I had them, it certainly was a mystery what exactly they were going to be prior to their arrival. Please note I would have expected the product description to give me some idea of whether this is produced for a single serve maker and if so, for which one(s).<br /><br />I am using single pods in my Senseo brewer, to make small cups (4 oz.) and am finding this most satisfactory. But in order to brew these larger-than-standard pods, I do have to use the 8 oz (two-pod) holder. No problem (as Marley would say). I do my usual routine of wetting the pod prior to brewing. Figure I deliberately make a strong cuppa; that would be my preference. It tastes great. I agree with the description of floral and berry, a very smooth, non-acidic cup of coffee.

review/summary: Excellent coffee in a great portable package
review/text: I'm by no means a a coffee expert, but I do drink a ton of it every day.  I do have sensitive tastebuds, and can tell the differences and nuances between a Starbucks Sumatra and a Dunkin Donuts dark roast.  My taste ranges mostly for medium to strong flavored coffees.  This coffee is on the medium side of the flavor spectrum, and it's free of the sourness found in some store brands.  I would call it a mild medium, and I like the portable package as a way to break up the monotony of what's offered at the office.  I can keep a pack or 2 in my desk drawer whenever, as the individual wrapping for each pod is quite handy.  There's nothing terribly distinctive about it- just a clean tasting coffee.  I will say this- I prefer it over the Starbucks Sumatra offered at work.  Recommended.

review/summary: Good flavor, but weak
review/text: There's more about Bob Marley on these coffee packets than brewing instructions. There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.  But machine compatibility? Light/med/dark roast? Recommended cup size.  Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very "Starbucks-y" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.  Unless you're running a caf&eacute;.

review/summary: Smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I've never had a cup of coffee that was so smooth tasting, kind of like when you buy the expensive liquor instead of the store brand. The coffee was a bit on the weak side but I felt the flavor of the Ethiopian yirgacheffe balanced that out somewhat.<br /><br />I bought some of these pods for my sons to use at college. They bring a sealed packet with them in their bookbags when they leave home for the day at school, and get free hot water from the drink vendors on campus for a nice pick me up between classes. They both love the coffee, and the convenience.<br /><br />I did take positive note of the ethically farmed notation on the box, and the fact that this product is certified organic. This company also supports Ital and Kicks for Cause. Nice.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: This is an astoundingly good cup of coffee!<br /><br />From the scent to the cup this is a great medium bodied coffee with NO burnt beans & NO bitter taste - during or after. The Ethiopia Yiragacheffe is the "exotic floral and berry" blend, yet all I could savor was a brilliant smooth cup of coffee that had absolutely NO need for sugar, honey or cream - it is quite frankly perfect as is. Also easy on the stomach.<br /><br />No instructions, but they are single serve pods made for single serve brewers. As for a standard brewer, compile pods for brewing according to taste. Experiment & enjoy.<br /><br />I shared this with my family, we have a new morning favorite.

review/summary: Very smooth flavor in a convenient form.
review/text: I find this coffee to be very pleasant with very little bitterness or acidity. Since it comes in individual pouches, much like a tea bag, the result is perfectly filtered. There are brewing machines that take such pouches, but I just put it on the bottom of a cup and pour boiling water over it. By adjusting the amount of time that you let it steep, you can regulate the flavor. Most experts suggest only a few minutes, similar to the amount of time a drip method would take. More than that is considered over-extraction that may result in more bitterness and other changes, but it is a matter of personal preference. The foil packs also keep each pod very fresh. It is also very convenient to take to work with you since it is so simple to brew.

review/summary: Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water
review/text: These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee.

review/summary: A Good company, but the coffee is a disappointment
review/text: I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization "kicks for a cause," a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good.

review/summary: Five Star Coffee but a One Star Pod
review/text: I nevr tasted 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added "flavored coffee creamer" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod.

review/summary: For people who Like Weak Coffee
review/text: I like my coffee strong so to me this tastes like strong tea that smells vaguely of coffee.  I prepared it the way you would tea--just put it in the cup and poured.  Maybe I should have done something differently but that's all we have (except a conventional coffee machine).  I tried squeezing it with my fingers and that helped a bit.  The only problem was that afterwards my fingers smelled like bitter coffee.  Squeezing the coffee bag with a spoon didn't produce quite the same result.<br /><br />So bottom line: if you like weak coffee, this is worth a try I think.  Otherwise, not so much.

review/summary: Pod Brewing - Bleh;  LOOSE Brewing FANTASTIC
review/text: I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.

That being said, I thought the flavor was good, nothing that blew me out of the water, but it was pleasant.  My first 2 cups weren't really strong enough for my liking.  I think I will try using a bit less water next time.  Overall, I love the aroma.  This product is organic and fair trade certified.  They also claim to be grown on a biodiverse farm, with workers who are treated ethically, and through sustainable cultivation...all good points for me.  Each pod is individually packaged which seals in freshness.

review/summary: Flavorful but weak
review/text: This coffee comes in individually foil-sealed pods. If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you.

review/text: I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this.

In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold.

review/summary: Dark Color, Watery Flavor
review/text: Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy.

review/text: I loved this coffee and it has an outstanding taste that I am sure will make it a big success! The coffee comes in  15 single serve ready-to-use-bags pr pouches that I found to make a "strong" cup of coffee.<br />I split open a bag and discovered that it hold three teaspoons full of coffee. I ripped open a couple of bags and made a 10 cup pot in my MR Coffee Coffeemaker (bought right here on amazon.com and was an "open-box" absolute bargain) and found it made a really fantastic pot of coffee. I ended up using it all in this manner.<br />I like the idea of this coffee, it is grown in an ethical manner in Jamaica and also in Africa and Central America)by the Marley family (of Reggae fame)<br /><br />A quick look on their web-site reveals they have several other offerings plus a neat (if pricey) coffee-maker)<br />If you like a great tasting coffee, this is worth a try even though it is a bit pricey!

review/text: I did not enjoy this coffee. This is more of that old world kind of beverage. You are drinking and feel transported 200 years ago, when they did not have keurig's and startbucks, if you know what I mean. It almost feels dusty. Not enough boldness, not enough flavor, not enough depth. Not for me.

review/summary: Unique flavors,  mediocre taste
review/text: We're a 2-3 cup a day coffee household.  This doesn't include all of the weekly trips to the coffee shop while at work for more specialized drinks.  Most of our home coffee is whole bean Colombian which we grind in a Krups espresso machine and coffee maker.  We're generally not terribly adventurous with our coffee choices so we were more than happy to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Organic and Fair Trade.<br /><br />+ Pleasant aromatic smell.<br /><br />+ Works great in a French Press.<br /><br />+ Great for travel.<br /><br />+ Appealing packaging and good overall message.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Tastes more like coffee flavored water than real coffee.<br /><br />- No instructions on or in the box on how to brew properly.<br /><br />- Improvisation may be necessary if you don't have a pod brewer.  We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.  As I mentioned earlier, the coffee taste was more like coffee flavored water than an actual brewed cup of coffee.  Despite the lack of taste, these pods are really handy if you travel or have a French Press at work.  If you're feeling adventurous or just want to support Organic and Fair Trade coffee growers then you may want to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.

review/text: This is excellent coffee and apparently the family of the late reggae star Bob Marley have something to do with it's production and/or marketing. It is a stronger blend coffee and someone with more acute taste buds than mine might argue, but I thought it tasted identical to Starbucks House Blend. This is a fair trade coffee so you are helping out the locals here more than the corporations. These are pods so you might want to have a machine that brews pods before you order, unlike me.

review/text: This is good coffee! As soon as the Marley Coffee arrived I brewed up a mug of the elixir, added only real cream, and sat back to see how it went. And it went well! I like my coffee strong, and although this is a medium bodied brew, it can be brewed to be stouter if you have the right coffee maker. The taste is smooth, not bitter, with a bit of fruitiness on the palate - particularly, nice hints of dark cherry. For a smooth and delightful change of pace, I recommend that you give Marley Coffee a try!

review/summary: Let me be blunt; I shot the roaster.
review/text: When I finally manage to convince myself to peel out from under the sheets each morning the second thing I'm interested in is a good strong cup of coffee. I categorize myself as a coffee drinker as opposed to a connoisseur since I'm amenable to buying whatever happens to be on sale at the market and spending my money on boutique blends happens about as often as the pope personally dispenses contraceptives.<br /><br />Now, my palate is sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between premium and plebian but the miserly gene invariably kicks into overdrive and inhibits forking over the cash for the former and definitely precludes an outlay for what my taste buds inform is a decent product yet well short of remarkable.<br /><br />The Marley organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a step above valued oriented Arabica but I was reminded of an ground variety with a bitter, burned aftertaste from the most notable of those upscale caf&eacute; house coffee providers (hey, I'm cheap and a hypocrite. If someone else is paying, I'm drinking).<br /><br />I tried the pods in a variety of ways (single cup brewing; steeped like tea for five minutes; open grind percolation; microwaved to the cusp of boiling) but regardless of method with eight ounces of water I found myself less than overwhelmed, and definitely unmotivated to order more.  Drinking it with cream and sugar was less offensive than black; the additives tended to mask the burnt aftertaste I detected.<br /><br />For some this group's commitment to social responsibility may influence a purchasing decision. Unfortunately, in my case that altruistic gene is in dormant state so it's all about the taste and price rather than ethical considerations.

review/text: Some reviewers say you can't teabag these pods, because the coffee will be week. However, if you put the pod in a cup, pour boiling water over it, then set a spoon on top of the pod, so it doesn't float to the top, leave it in the cup for about twenty seconds or so, then use two spoons and gently squeeze the pod over the coffee cup, voila, you get a nice, rich cup of coffee.

review/summary: Good coffee, but minus a point for lack of instructions.
review/text: I ordered this coffee not knowing it was for a Senseo coffee maker.  I brewed it like tea with the written side down in cup.  The pod floated to the top of a coffee mug with hot water in it.  I waited for about 5 minutes, then I used a spoon to purge the pod against the inside of the cup.  I like strong coffee.  I left the pod in.  I sipped it and it tasted very fresh.  Not bitter. I am enjoying these pods, even though I am using them "wrong".  I would buy these again, since I love coffee, but hate the mess with the grounds.  Plus it is mellow coffee. I think the price is right.

Let it brew in really hot water for 5 minutes and squeeze it out real good and presto you have easy to make single serve coffee.  I can't see any reason to put it in a coffee maker...total waste of electricity.  It is mild but strong enough in my humble opinion, but I hate starbucks coffee because it tastes too strong and burnt to me.

review/summary: I Love The Message!
review/text: I had never heard for Marley's Coffee before, so as the was reading all of the information on the box, the last thing I looked at was the top of the box, to find out that the Marley is as in Bob Marley!<br /><br />Upon first looking at the box, the first thing I noticed was how the perimeter of the box reminded me of Christmas, with the red, green and gold colors.<br /><br />I especially loved what I saw written on the back of the box.  It really seems to come from the heart.<br /><br />It says "That pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial.  They know where their beans come from, and how they are grown.  The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. "We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for.

review/summary: Darn good coffee, but don't "teabag" it!
review/text: I've seen some reviews for these coffee "pods" where people say they used the pod like a teabag, just throwing it into a cup, pouring boiling water over it and letting it steep for a while. Those reviews usually also complain that their coffee is too weak.<br /><br />The coffee is weak because "teabagging" with these pods just doesn't work, in my experience. You need to use a pod coffee brewer, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>, or, if you feel like spending a lot of money, maybe the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00580QKVK">SunCafe Coffee Pod Brewer</a>. Personally, since I don't own one of these brewers and I didn't know that "teabagging" doesn't work until I tried it, I ended up tearing open the pods and emptying them into my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z48XZ0">Frieling Coffee-for-One Filter</a>. (Putting an unopened pod into the coffee-for-one filter didn't work either.) The packaging of this product really ought to include some instructions about how to (and how not to) use it.<br /><br />Once I started brewing it correctly, I really liked the flavor of this coffee. I like yirgacheffe coffees in general, and this is a good one. It's a rich, fairly dark roast, with some nice earthy and berry flavors to it.

review/text: I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk. The flavor was mild, pleasant, but for me, the taste was too bland, did not stand out. Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore, not ultimately satisfying. I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite.

review/text: As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court

review/text: It's about time that coffee takes the road of tea and become more user friendly. The battle between pods/bags/filters has been firmly for filters in the past few years. Can this product sway the battle?<br /><br />Sadly, it only produces a mediocre cup of coffee. The 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, produced under free trade and in an organic environment, should have a bold robust flavor. Maybe it is the bags themselves or the beans but the flavor was thin enough to be overpowered by minimal amounts of sugar or milk.<br /><br />That being said, on the road, it's not a bad cup of joe. 4 stars for portability and ease of use.

review/text: I gave this product only three stars simply because the coffee was not quite strong enough for my taste.  My usual morning coffee consists of a stronger brew, and this particular product did not give me a strong enough coffee.  The coffee has a couple of redeeming qualities, first it is a fair trade coffee, which I really appreciate.  Secondly, the coffee comes in very convenient single serve packs, which make brewing coffee very simple and fast in the morning.  The single serve packs were also a disadvantage for the coffee because you could not adjust the brew strength of the coffee.  I found that when I made my coffee in the morning, using my normal proceedures that the coffee was not strong enough once I added the cream and sugar to the coffee.<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee was palatable, if you are a person that likes a light roast, or a light brew.  If that is the type of brew that you are after, this is an excellent coffee for you, personally however I found the coffee a bit too light for my taste.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: I don't have a pod coffeemaker, so I cut open the packets and put the coffee in my coffee jar when I ran out of the the French roast that was in it. I use one scoop of coffee with my Bodum French press every morning.<br /><br />So how did this coffee fare? Very well. I didn't find it too weak nor two strong. Very robust, not harsh. I don't think I'd recommend buying it if you have to cut open the pods and pour out the coffee the way I did, but you can buy the One Love Whole Bean Organic coffee from their website and grind it yourself. However, if you do have a pod brewer, then I'd recommend the pod version here without any reservation, because this is very good coffee.
