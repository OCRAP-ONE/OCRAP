review/summary: Very healthy treat ~
review/text: When you've got a little pup that you care enough about to buy treats, you want to give him/her the best, and I believe Wellness is just that.  My 4-mo. old Maltese would live on these if I let him, forgoing his kibble altogether, but we can't have that, can we?<br /><br />My puppy gets stinky puppy breath for a while after having one, so be forewarned.

review/summary: Perfect for Training
review/text: My puppy (4 month old Bichon) loves these!  He actually loves them a bit too much.  He goes crazy when he has the opportunity to have one.  These are perfect for training because they are really motivating for him (unless he gets too excited).  I also feel good about giving him a treat that is healthy for him.  I usually break them up into tiny pieces (8+ pieces per treat) that way we can do many training exercises and he doesn't get too many treats.  These are very soft and smell flavorful (I'm assuming they are...).  We keep them in a treat tote and they stay soft for a long time.

review/summary: Lily & Tigger ADORE these.
review/text: So I had bought a 2 pack of these same treats from pet co while I bought their cage back when they were a month or two. I totally forgot I stashed the other bag of these in my cabinet.. Soo cute. I forgot how much they had loved these back then! They beg and start doing tricks for me when I ask if they want a treat. or if I open the door to the cabinet. lol<br /><br />BTW:<br />This is how they learned all their tricks and I even taught them to be potty trained this way! (I'd put them on the pad and when they finally would go I'd make a bit of a fuss & break a piece off a little treat as I thought they were too big to be given whole to such a tiny pup) Oh and these helped me crate train them. I'd say mimi time or let's go to sleep and if they would listen and run in the cage for sleep I'd break a bit of the treat n give them it through the cage. But now they are 8 mo. old and 8 - 10 lbs I give two each just cuz haha. They really haven't liked any treats so much as these. I would definitely buy some again.. & I will cuz it's cheaper here! yay :D - Smell isn't bad to me, milder then most stinky treats you think of. They are puppies, they like smelly stuff anyways! haha

review/summary: GREAT FOR  SALIVA/TEAR STAINS!
review/text: I have a pure white, 2lb, 5 month old, Morkie(maltese/yorkie mix).  We were having problems with staining around her mouth, feet, and HORRIBLE tear stains.  She was also constipated one day and then had toothpaste texture poo the next on her old dog food.(diamond puppy) and dog treats.  After a lot of research I decided to try Orijen Puppy food and Wellness Puppy Treats.<br /><br />AMAZING!! NO MORE SALIVA OR TEAR STAINS!! I can not tell you how much better she looks! her coat is even softer! as for her bowls, they are a nice, round, and firm.  She seems much happier and is a lot more active. I think the treats and the dog food are a great mix for our dog.  She NEVER got that excited over her old walmart (lots of different varieties) treats or her diamond puppy dog food...but now she gets to jumping and spinning whenever she hears the treat bag or dog food bag open!<br /><br />*****I am sure that most of the positive results are from the Orijen Puppy food, but its nice to know that the treats arn't effecting her!***

review/text: I have a 4 lb Maltese and this breed of dog has extremely small teeth and small bite (actually even smaller than my cat's teeth) so she has problems with many chews and treats I have gotten her because they are just too big or too hard for her to chew.  These soft mini treats are the best. They are small enough she can get them into her mouth and soft enough she can chew them.  I use them as her "good girl" treats and she bounces around waiting for me to open the package.  I think if she could give you a review she would give these five stars.  P.S.  She hasn't had any digestive trouble from eating these treats.

review/text: I wanted a training treat made of good quality ingredients, and this one fits the bill and comes from a company with a decent reputation. My husky/GSD puppy really enjoys these treats, and I can break them down to be as small as needed, if we're working on something repetitive and I don't want to give her large bites over and over. I would buy these again.

review/summary: Perfect for Finicky Eaters
review/text: My Havanese would literally spit out any other treat he was given.  Finally, at his first trip to the groomer, the store owner offered to open several varieties of treats to see if he would accept any of them.  We struck gold with these.  He devoured the treat he was offered and has come to recognize the Wellness bag.<br /><br />For the humans, these are great training treats because they're soft and pliable - very easy to tear into pieces so you can stretch the benefit you get out of each treat (which also helps to keep calories in check for little ones).  Since they're grain-free and all-natural, the ingredients are great for growing pups.  Wellness also offers a similar version for adult dogs, which makes the transition easy on their tummies, too :)

review/summary: A True Addiction
review/text: Adopting a Miniature Schnauzer after the loss of my Standard Schnauzer last month, I felt the pressure of having to house break a puppy once again. The previous owner allowed him to remain in his crate too long each day, so I geared up for the battle. I used chicken strips to train the Standard; however, my Miniature nearly jumped out of the shopping cart when a Petco dog trainer gave him a sample of this treat. It took me nearly three months to house break my Standard compared to less than two weeks for my Miniature. He receives this treat when he urinates outside and another (expensive) treat for his poop in order to understand the difference between the two in addition to preventing him from "eating the same ol' cracker for both actions". I have never witnessed a dog go wild over a treat until now, and I am willing to invest in such product as long as we both experience an award in the end.<br /><br />After reading customer reviews for this product, I am glad to know there is a common factor of bad gas and runny poop for several owners. I can only speak for myself; however, I reduced both the portion size and amount I feed him daily along with feeding him hard dog food instead of half (soft) and half (hard). My best guess is that it takes a minute for the dog's system to accept this treat, because my dog's poop has returned to being hard. The gas is not a pleasant smell; however, we all have gas so I have learned to live with it. Such sacrifice is worth the money considering his positive attitude to rush outside to squat long enough to get what he wants. I can show you multiple urine areas in my carpet my Standard was guilty for during his training; however, I can hold up three fingers to represent the number of incidents my Miniature has committed to date.<br /><br />This particular puppy treat is worth the money. If you want to preserve your carpet, reduce moneys for carpet cleaning solutions, etc., this treat is your BEST solution by far.

She literally leaps into the air trying to get to the bag! In fact I'm on my way to the pet store in just a few minutes to pick her up another bag of them. My only suggestion is not to buy them here, they are almost half the price at my local pet store than they are at the price on Amazon!

review/summary: Better Ones are Out Their...
review/text: I didn't have a problem with these treats for about 2 weeks, I was able to introduce my puppy to training with them. But...that changed. Our puppy used to love these treats and, all of a sudden she barely even SNIFFED them. She sniffed and walked away. It was the same thing with the food. That wasn't very helpful when I tried to train her... The people at our local PETCO said that dogs love them, but probably dogs that would eat anything mostly. If your dog is a picky eater, then try other treats. After she started to dislike these, we went to our local Healthy Spot and they recommended Stella and Chewy's Carnivore Kisses, and both us and Valentine are happier with them :D The only plus side I found with these treats were that you could make them even smaller. They were good for 2 weeks though ):

review/summary: Bratty puppy loves these
review/text: After going back and forth between pet stores exchanging bags of treats over and over again, i finally found that my 14 week old shih tzu Bailey loves these. He also loves the Wellness Just for Puppy canned food as well - gobbles it up. He is one of those pups that is super particular about his food. With other brands of food, he wont eat just dry - it must be mixed with wet AND must be heated to a certain temperature. With Wellness, he gobbles it all up mixed with his dry food, no matter what the temp.<br /><br />All the other brands of treats that i have tried with Bailey, he would sniff then then turn his nose up at them and walk away. I was getting frustrated that i could not find any treats that my spoiled little pups would like! After seeing how much he liked the Wellness puppy wet food, i thought that i should give these a try. He LOVES them. now we can really make progress on training Bailey. Its impossible to teach a pup anything without treats he likes!<br /><br />Im so happy with this brand and i cant wait til we finish his old dry food so i can switch him to the wellness dry food as well!

review/text: The treats are GREAT. My puppy will follow any directive if offered this reward. However, you can purchase this same pouch (3.5 oz) at PetSmart for $4.99 full price. I made the mistake of purchasing this same product for around $9 each, assuming it was a larger bag (the size of the adult Wellness treats that cost $11 in the stores -- also very good products, loved by my dogs).  Purchasing at that price was my mistake. Just remember when purchasing this product that one 3.5 oz. bag of Puppy Wellness treats costs $4.99 in any pet store.

review/text: Both my dogs, a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and a 9 week old Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, love these training treats. I don't feed the whole treat but get probably 3-4 training treats out of each square. They are happy with it. They were competing with each other to go through hoops and weave poles and over very low jumps (for the puppy) just to get these treats. Normally my Aussie isn't that interested in the agility but it's amazing what some treats and a puppy will do!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HBBQKY">Wellness Just For Puppy Treats, 3.5 oz. Pouch</a><br /><br />Okay so my mom was recommended by the breeder,  this "treat" for her new 3 .4 pound,  Bichon Bolognese pup (said with sarcasm but with so much love) as it was a great product. And it is. On a pup this size you can actually get about 9 serving's of treats. Seriously. @ 3 lbs little bits are best. I am figuring with a standard pup of 12-15 lbs you could even do half. The product is very soft and chewy- great for teething, and are scored- so cutting is a cinch. Puppy seems to really love them and in less then 2 weeks of ownership my mom had him learning new commands.<br /><br />*** I bag for this bichon Bolo lasted about 3 weeks. So for the moneys, on this sized pup- so worth it!

I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.

This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.<br /><br />As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?

review/summary: Best Pretzels!
review/text: My husband and I were looking for a good snack and these fit the bill for us. More fiber than your normal pretzel, lots of flavor and has a decent amount of protein too. These are terrific! Its been part of our diet for over a year and we have lost about 60 pounds each. We make our own hummus and eat these with it, or I eat them with a wedge of laughing cow cheese or peanut butter.

review/summary: GOOD STUFF!
review/text: I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the "average" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again.

review/summary: Nice flavor, and better for you too!
review/text: I started with Newman's Own Pretzels with the Protein ones.  The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings.  The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!

review/summary: Great Pretzels...and I love pretzels!
review/text: These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!

review/summary: Great source of fiber and protein--but TASTES great, too!
review/text: I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels.

review/summary: Its burned
review/text: I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark brown. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.

Not too salty, just enough, and not the long rods that break and leave crumbs everywhere (like if you're lounging on the couch watching tv, say) - these are shorter rods, the perfect size for a proper crumbless - or near crumbless - pretzel-indulging experience.  They're fairly healthy, too, as far as snacks go.

review/text: These are by far my favorite pretzels I've ever had. The taste is mild, which is what I like in a pretzel (that's not chocolate covered), and they're just the right ratio of thickness and size, not like some that are so thick and dry that they stick in your throat, or so thin that you're chewing super-salty air. Plus they're actually a bit healthier than most others. Unfortunately they're also more expensive, but I'm happy to say I always get what I pay for with these.

The first two cases I bought from a different distributor were fine, however in the last case I purchased from Amazon, all the pretzels tasted stale, although the bags weren't out of expiration and didn't appear to be opened.

review/text: We buy the organic spelt pretzels by Newman's Own. This company sends them fast and so nicely - packed and separated in individual slots so they don't break or pop open. The pretzels themselves are yummy. Lately we've been dipping into different mustard flavors - a great snack! A good variety of non-salted ones mixed with some salty ones, a good balance. They taste better than your average pretzel on the market and they are healthier for you. I recommend the spelt pretzels!

I was making chocolate-dipped pretzels and was trying to figure out how many I could put in each gift bag, so I had my kids count how many there were per Newman's Own 8-Ounce bag.  There are about 40 pretzels per bag.  I ordered two cases trying to make sure I had enough, so hopefully this info will save someone from doing what I did--buying twice as much as needed.  Now we get to eat them.  :0)

review/text: I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk....

review/text: Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more. Very crunchy without any hint that it is fortified with soy protein. Only issue with the product is that every few bags I get several oddly shaped pretzels which are thicker and crunchier which is actually a plus in my opinion. The best part is that they're both organic AND affordable! My favorite way to eat them is to pair them with a good quality chocolate for a sweet treat.

review/text: I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.

review/text: Discovered these online and looked high and low for some that I would not have to buy a case.  Well I found them at Whole Foods, bought a bag - then I ended up ordering a case since I don't live near a WF & I wanted them to be my snack of choice. Anyway, my VERY picky 13 year old daughter really like them.  They really taste like pretzels not like the gluten-free/high protein ones. My only complaint, dare I say it is, they need more salt!  Even sesame seeds would be good they need a little something more.  I don't think I will order a case soon b/c that's a lot of pretzels(!) but am hoping the word gets out and health food stores close to me would start carrying them so I can buy just a bag or two.

review/summary: Ohhhhh, so that's a stick...
review/text: didn't know what the diff was between the "sticks" and the the "rods" because when I was little (yes, I really was little... a long, long time ago) I used to go to the "candy store" and buy two pretzels or pretzel sticks, not knowing that what I was really buying was a pretzel rod....live and learn...<br /><br />Anyway, once I realized that I had bought these "mini-rods" I could get on with the taste testing. Testing good. Up to the Newman standards...and there is this completely illogical belief that having the exact same calories spread over three or four pieces instead of one large pretzel is more satisfying...bonus...

review/text: These are the thin style pretzels that are truly "thin" which is what my family likes.  Many "thin" pretzels are very thick.  The best thing about these is they are organic and a  Newman's Own product, which makes me feel good about my kids eating them.  I send them in their lunches to school and they love them.  Healthy snack and good price on Amazon.

review/text: Newman's Own Organic Pretzels are far better than any other pretzel I've eaten. As most probably know, any product Newman's Own produces is superior to competitor brands. My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.

review/summary: I've liked every kind that I've tried
review/text: My latest purchase was the Honey Wheat variety, but I've had the Hi-Protein and Spelt varieties in the past.  I have really enjoyed all three of them.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to "normal" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g<br /><br />Some typical advice - watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7-oz bags, 12-pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7-oz bag.

review/text: The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online.

review/summary: Perfect Texture! True Fruit Taste! Irresistable!
review/text: Lets face it, when you buy gummies of any kind you already expect them to be...well gummy! I always dreaded it when the kids would toss a box of these fruit snacks into my shopping cart. This is why:<br />1) I knew they would not actually eat all of them and there would be waste.<br />2) I knew I would find the waste stuck to the back seat of my car, or on the bottom of my new socks.<br />3) And I knew there would be conflict the next time they asked me to purchase these for the above reasons.<br /><br />But I caved when they begged, pleaded, and promised to eat all of these. I could not resist them, or the fact that they had angry birds on the box. Admit it folks, this was a great tactic for advertising this product and making it sell. And yes being a parent of small children, I fell for it.<br /><br />But the wonderful thing was the kids actually gobbled them up, every last one, and only shared one pouch with me. They were that good. And I do not care much for the gummy candies. Becasue they are basically the same. They gum, and some you can't chew and the flavor seems to be superficial. Not these. I fell in love with the orange and yellow ones. I am a citrus fan and they were yummy.

review/text: So far I only opened one can.<br /><br />Let me put it this way: if you didn't know it was a salmon you wouldn't would not identify it as such. It is very similar to canned tuna color-wise (white-ish small chunks) and pretty much tasteless. Not even similar to what I purchased in a "big box store" in a larger can (can't  recall the brand but it might have been Bumble Bee too).<br /><br />On the can it says "Tuna style" (you can see it on Amazon's picture if you zoom in). Fish origin is unclear except that it says "Premium Wild" and "Product of Thailand".<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because I only opened one can. If the second one is the same I will lower the rating to 1 star.<br /><br />UPDATE: second can (and all others after it) is the same. Lowering rating to 1 star.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.  Nice cheese flavor.
review/text: I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them.

review/text: I just received this today and I am greatly disappointed.<br />Here is why (Cons)<br />  *Not glass - I know it says ceramic grinder, and yes, the actual grinding part is ceramic. The clear part is plastic.  I thought it was glass, and ordered because I am trying to get rid of plastics due to a hormone imbalance.<br />  *Small - It looked larger in the photo than it really is.  The grinder is less than 6.5" from the very bottom of the grinder to the top of the knurl.<br />  *Crooked - The top sits crooked on the grinder.<br />  *Expensive - If the grinder were glass and larger, this would be a good value.  With it being plastic and small, it is greatly overpriced.<br />My suggestion is - Buy a glass grinder and order a bulk coarse Himalayan Sea Salt to grind in it.<br />  *Not enough of the Himalayan Salt to make it worth the price.<br />(Pros)<br />  *Excellent salt, that is why I suggest buying the Himalayan Sea Salt in bulk and purchasing a better grinder.<br /><br />I made this review to help others who are trying to rid their environment of plastics and heal their system from hormone imbalances.

Glad I got two grinders; one for home and one for the RV.  It was a mite pricey, as I was able to purchase some more salt to refill from the chiropracter for a lot less.  I would recommend the product.  The grinder was not too big and cumbersome, but was a good size.

review/text: Do a taste test. Wet your finger and dip it in some standard table salt. Then repeat with the Himalayan Sea Salt. Notice the difference? We sure did. The Himalayan Sea Salt is not as harsh or bitting, and has a sweeter (yes sweeter) aftertaste. A little less than two years ago I started trying different artesian salts. So far, the Himalayan Salt has been my favorite. It has a mellower flavor, though it is still just as salty. There are also the studies that show it is better for you than your over processed and recently made table salt. I am not sure about that, but I know I like it. If it has trace minerals and no pollutants, so much the better. The grinder is plastic but it has held up well and can be refilled. I'm not sure of the benefit of grinding (unless you like the ritual) so if you just want quick and easy, you may want to consider the [[ASIN:B000SAOKIU  Fine Grain Shaker)]] version.<br /><br />It costs a little more, but I think it is worth it. At least try it and see for yourself.

review/text: While I like the product overall -- nice design, good feel, etc -- I don't feel that it's completely up to the task of neatly grinding the moist sea salt.  It grinds evenly and without difficulty, but the crushed particles combined w/ the moisture cause the salt to buildup on the underside of the grinding mechanism instead of falling naturally.  This is understandable and may not be a problem with a suitable solution.

review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for adding to creamed coffee to get the taste of Irish Cream without the added calories, sugar or alcohol.  Real Bailey's Irish Cream has 7.4 Grams of sugar, 136 mg or 45% of your daily cholesterol, 33 mg of salt and 7.4 grams of carbohydrates.  This product adds no calories, no sugar, no carbohydrates and no cholesterol to your coffee.<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

review/text: These things are too good for 'Mortal Words.' Word of caution, if there's a See's candy store in the area, buy them direct. Shipping cost will take your breath away.

review/summary: See's peanut brittle... great taste, questionable advertising
review/text: This is by far the best peanut brittle I ever tasted.  I was puzzled by the '1 star' review given earlier.  I checked the box and they are not accurate in their advertising.  Corn syrup NOT pure sugar....<br />  Still, ain't tasted none better........

review/summary: See's peanut brittle
review/text: Best peanut brittle ever!  However, I was disappointed in the amount of loose peanuts and candy material in the bottom of the box.  In addition, the shipping cost doubled the cost of my order; outrageous!<br />Donald

review/summary: Recipient says Best Ever Brittle!
review/text: I bought 2 lbs. of this peanut brittle for my Dad for Christmas 2010, and he specifically requested the same thing again for 2011. Mom and Dad said it is fresh tasting and delicious, not "fakey". All the reviews are true, I guess. I hope they save a piece for me! Just ordered 2 more lbs.

review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: I love brittle, and let me say this - this brittle is THE BEST I've ever had.  It is made with milk - I think most other brittles are made with water.  The brittle itself is somewhat opaque and absolutely fantastic.  I would order this stuff without the peanuts, just the brittle, if it was sold that way - it is that good.  It is somewhat less hard and at the same time actually more "brittle" than other peanut brittles.  Did I say that it is really fantastic?  I tell you, if I lived out West, I would be 20lbs heavier because of this stuff.
