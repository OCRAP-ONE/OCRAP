review/text: I can't go a day without having at least one cup of this tea. It's so fragrant and delicious. Just the right balance of green tea and jasmine. Very smooth. I disagree about the caffeine kick noted by another commenter. Maybe I'm immune to the caffeine, but I don't feel it, I drink a cup in the evening and go to sleep just fine.

review/summary: Not as good as Tazo
review/text: I bought this tea because my husband loves the double bergamot from Stash. I'd been drinking Tazo brand, and I have to admit that Tazo is quite a bit better. This one is not strong enough for me, and I can't taste the mint as much as I can in the Tazo.

review/summary: Good tea blend. Not 'the best there is' but it's more than decent
review/text: The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)<br /><br />Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea.  I am a huge iced tea drinker (more than a quart a day).  I have tried lots of different brands over the years and gradually gotten into lighter and lighter tasting teas.  For many years my tea of choice was darjeeling, which is the cadillac of teas; very light and refreshing.  Then one day I sampled this green and white combination and WOW.  It is light, refreshing, and since it is green, also good for me!  I've been hooked every since.  I even bought special mugs (16 ounces) so I can drink a decent amount and not have to refill so often.  Occasionally I see it in the grocery store but they can't keep it in stock (so the word must be out how wonderful this tea is!).  I now get my fix through Amazon's service where they send 6 boxes every other month.  I don't have to worry about 'when' the grocery is going to get their next shipment anymore.  So if you enjoy a light tea give this one a try.  I am sure you will be very, very pleased at the refreshing taste.

review/text: I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it.

review/text: I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child, so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine, I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways, thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor, but I just couldn't do it! Well, that is just my 2 cents. If anyone else has tried this and agrees with me, let me know!

review/text: I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried.

review/summary: Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best
review/text: After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!

review/summary: Not as good as I had hoped
review/text: I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6.

review/summary: Very good blend of primarily green tea
review/text: Both my best friend and I LOVE this tea.  Embarrassingly, we are quasi-tea snobs each in our own way.  We have tried all forms, brands, etc including the very pricey varieties, and we agreed that for a white/green blend this is perfect.  It is not too mild or smooth, nor is it too astringent or bitter.  It is a nice golden color with a tempting, soothing aroma.  It has good mouth feel - light but not too light.  It is very good plain or with some honey.<br />It contains white, green blend (Chinese, Japanese, Darjeeling and Assam from India, and organic green from Sri Lanka).  It is really a very nice tea.  Please note that of the teas that are blended into each sachet, only one is organic.

I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as "grassy"? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one.

I go through about half a gallon of green tea a day, so Im always willing to try new flavors, brands, etc. This is the only one that I have had to literally choke down. This tea is bitter, but thats not the real reason its so bad. The taste is cheap, overpowering, and unpleasant.<br /><br />I think either Stash has its employees writing reviews, or amazonians are being suckered in by the snazzy/hip box and packets of this truly awful tea.

review/summary: Excellent flavor...the best I have tried
review/text: Since I drink between eight and ten cups of green tea a day, I am very fussy about the taste.  It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, "that is why it is called green tea!"

review/summary: My favorite Green Tea
review/text: I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!

If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do.

review/summary: Still a cinnamon tea, but not as overpowering as in Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea
review/text: This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.<br /><br />I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.<br /><br />Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more.

review/summary: Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value
review/text: ****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****

review/summary: Very good for what it is
review/text: We've been "product testing" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama "Sushi Bar" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea "taste" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. "Sushi Bar"-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff.

review/summary: overpowering lemon grass
review/text: This tea sounded great. I lived in the middle east and love the real moroccan mint tea. The real tea includes spearmint and green tea only. Honey is typically added. In this case all you can taste is lemon grass and the only hint of mint is peppermint, not spearmint. I really regret buying a whole case of this stuff. I would highly recommend buying Twinnings green tea with mint. It doesn't have "Moroccan mint" as a title, but it is a lot closer to the original namesake. Stash has a little bit of false advertising going on here. It should really be called lemon grass green tea with a picture of lemon grass on the box. It is anything but Moroccan.

review/summary: Soft, Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea has a fragrant bouquet, and an unusual taste that comes from the blend of red tea and white tea. The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of "potent antioxidants", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Very tasty - Could it also help me lose weight?
review/text: I got this after reading about a study that said four cups of white tea a day - and no other changes to diet or exercise - could result in 4 to 8 lbs of weight loss in a year, and would actually reduce the number of fat cells in a person's body!  The study suggested that green tea was also good for weight loss, but not as good as white.  (http://www.naturalnews.com/026220.html is one article about the study, but Google it and you'll find lots."<br /><br />So?  I split the difference and got both.<br /><br />For those that think that four cups of tea is a lot?  You're right.

Stash's Mint Green Tea is different. It has a rich and well-rounded flavor, which I prefer to that of their flowery plain green tea. And the price is quite reasonable for such a refreshing beverage, especially if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />As the weather warms up, this versatile tea is well-suited to both hot and iced brewing. I would recommend it over any other bagged tea.

review/summary: Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor
review/text: I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!

review/summary: Nice mild minty tea, actually makes an enjoyable cup.
review/text: I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.<br />I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks. One would be too strong, the other too bland.<br />I think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass, making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil.<br />I found the mint to be nicely pronounced, and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable, with a little bit of honey it's really good.<br />So if you're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine, and like me you like it mildly paired with mint. Then give this tea a shot.<br />(I do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first, so that you're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine)

review/text: I've tried so many different Jasmine teas and this one is my favorite. There are some I just do not like. This brand has a wonderful flavor. I have been drinking this for about 5 years now, it is a good deal if you buy this from Amazon on auto ship. You can't beat the price.

review/summary: Tea for a Rainy Afternoon
review/text: I'm trying to drink more green tea because it is so good for you. I'm trying all the Stash green teas one after the other. This one is a favorite as it had a strong Pomegranate and Raspberry flavor I love. By mixing these flavors in with green tea it makes green tea less bitter. The ingredients in this tea include: green tea, chamomile, hibiscus, orange peel, pomegranate flavor, raspberry flavor and Japanese matcha. A perfect tea with honey on a rainy afternoon.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: the flavor was not what I expected
review/text: Had this been labeled "green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.

review/summary: Very nice cuppa green...
review/text: This green tea by Stash, just might be one of the best ways to get your jasmine tea fix, and your antioxidants, to boot. The scent of jasmine blossoms comes through very nicely. You can actually enjoy this tea without any sugar, though I still prefer a little bit. There were no discernible aftertastes and I'd say the caffeine kick was light. I'd certainly buy this tea again and again...pass the crab rangoons, please!

review/summary: Exquisite Tea
review/text: I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what "goji berry flavor" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional."<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.  Not so mysterious after all.  I recommend getting the superfruit sampler where you get to try this flavor and five others.  I have found them all to be outstanding and go back for more all the time.

review/summary: Clean and subtle rather than grassy, a stand-out flavor in a crowded field
review/text: I drink STASH PREMIUM MOROCCAN MINT GREEN TEA all day with no adverse "overdose" effects from caffeine.  The flavor is not grassy like some green teas, but very clean.  I don't normally like mint taste in anything other than gum or toothpaste, but this mint is subtle and goes great with the clean taste of the tea.  Besides green tea, the ingredients are spearmint, lemongrass, and peppermint.  Lemongrass is another ingredient that can be overwhelming, but if it's truly in there, I can't taste it.  So as I write this, I am realizing it contains a lot of flavors that shouldn't work for me, but they do!  In fact, I enjoy it so much, I get a little anxious if I let myself run low.  It's a great thing to be able to order it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />I do want to note that the tea can get a little bitter if steeped too long.  I try to go no longer than five minutes, but I often forget about it at work.  For me, it's drinkable but noticeable.  On the other hand, I'm not an aficionado.  I don't worry about the temperature of the water I use to brew the tea.  At home, I use the hot water that comes out of my Keurig coffee maker; at work, I use the hot water out of the filtered water dispenser.  As evidenced by the amount I consume, the flavor comes out great!

review/summary: Hot water
review/text: I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed.

review/text: I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands. I was careful with water temp and how long I let it steep and it wasn't bitter. It tastes somewhat clean and fresh but I like the much less expensive Salada better and I don't have to be careful with it like I do with Stash teas.

review/summary: Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea
review/text: Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(

Not strong, though, and very, very smooth.<br /><br />A bit of honey or sweetener is nice with this one.<br /><br />I don't get distinct tastes of other things that they put in the tea -- the flavor is more of a gestalt.

The caffeine content is not as high as the one of coffee, or even regular green tea, which makes this a good beverage choice at all times of the day.

The only thing I have to say that's negative would be the box design makes it difficult to grab the packets from the little like half circle opening, just open up the back otherwise they get all messed up and you have to push your fingers and root around trying to grab one of them and then pull them out etc.  Really good tea for a really nice price.  Even though I just bought 6 boxes, I would buy this again for sure (me and my family have already gone through three, and I gave one away as a gift).

I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left, nearly out of stock, does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like, the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.
