review/summary: A Great Option for a Low Carb Snack
review/text: You're likely here because you're considering this as a healthy snacking alternative as part of your low-carb, or otherwise low calorie/low-fat diet.  So I won't waste time mentioning the health benefits of the crackers.. they obviously meet the "specs" for the answer to low-glycemic cracker snacking. (if you were looking for taste, and not health, you'd be checking out the chicken in a biskit or something, right?)<br /><br />Ok, the Taste: I'd recommend adding something, like cheese or low sugar jelly, etc.. I personally add avocado most of the time.  The first time I tried one, right out of the package, I couldn't nail down what this reminded me of, though I knew it tasted familiar.<br /><br />Then I realized what this was:<br /><br />I used to eat All-Bran, during that time when I was a cereal-eater a while ago.<br /><br />So These crackers are basically like you got to the bottom of your bowl of All-Bran and the milk is gone, and you're eating the small amount of dry All-bran that never got touched by the milk.  So it's really not that bad a taste, is what I'm saying.<br /> They're 1.) healthy, 2.) cheap, and best of all, 3.) they help you stay committed to your low-carb efforts<br /><br />( but please don't provide this at a party, on a snack tray -- if you do, you're braver than I am )

review/summary: Low-Carb Dieters Rejoice!
review/text: Eating these crackers by themselves is not pleasant, but eating them with low-carb spreads or dips makes them extremely palatable, & with only 2g net carbs per slice, they are a godsend to those of us who can't forego snacks altogether, even when dieting. For those who are trying to lose weight by counting calories, it would be better if these could be flavored with some herbs & spices to make them more appetizing. But for those of us doing the low-carb thing, these are terrific!

review/summary: I dream of these cracker
review/text: Yes, on their own they are a little cardboardy, but with a little lite cream cheese or peanut butter or other creative toppings they are great. I love the way they fill me up and fill the "NEED" for a carb attack. At first I thought they were awful, but then I started craving them and even thinking of them at night and what I could put on them.  Now I don't really even need to have any topping, but I always have to have some with me as they are my addiction.  I have to thank my boss for turning me on to these and now I'm hooked.

review/summary: Type 2 Diabetic - Helps Keep My Blood Glucose Stable
review/text: I have type 2 diabetes and I eat one of these with a wedge of light Laughing Cow cheese about a half hour before dinner and the fiber helps fill me up and keeps my blood glucose from spiking after I eat dinner.<br /><br />I agree with one other reviewer that these can be tough on your digestive tract BUT ONLY at first. If your body isn't used to so much fiber at once it will "rebel" a bit but after eating one a day for about a week, all unpleasantness passed for me and they really do fill me up and help me eat less at dinner.<br /><br />Fiber helps keep my blood glucose stable without all the spikes that can stimulate appetite as well as cause my blood glucose to be above normal limits. Fiber acts like "brakes" to carbs and sugar.<br /><br />I always keep these in my pantry. They aren't the most tasty cracker I've ever had but they are palatable with the Laughing Cow cheese and it's an easy, quick way to add more fiber to your diet even if you aren't a diabetic.

review/summary: Will Order More
review/text: Now, I must state my opinion as a woman whose weight has gone up and down over the past 15 years. Unfortunately I am on the upper end again. I know there are no magic pills, weight-loss suits are a scam, and the only way to lose weight is to cut calories drastically and get off the couch by walking/running and doing some weight training.<br />My problem is my appetite. Cutting calories and "bad" foods sounds easy but if your stomach is screaming it's NOT easy. I read about these crackers in a book, that those anorexic looking models eat these to stave off hunger. OK, I gave them a try.<br />They work for me. If I have a couple if I feel hunger coming on, with a bottle of water, it really does take that hunger away. Give it about 30 minutes. I could have skipped dinner last night from a few of these crackers in the afternoon.<br />The taste isn't awful, just bland. They are SUPER dry so have some water or coffee/tea at least with them.<br />Something about these things satisfies me and makes me less hungry. That's how I'll lose some of this weight, by not stuffing myself.<br />I'll be back here for more when I'm running out!

review/summary: If you want to eat healthy
review/text: These crackers are the greatest to stop your craving for carb.  They do taste bland by themselves since the majority of the ingredient is wheat bran.  I usually eat it with my favorite spread which is  the artichoke parmesan dip.  Most importantly they are healthy and you can satisfy your hunger without eating too much with these.

review/summary: Pretty much what I expected - dry as dust but good for you
review/text: After reading many of the reviews and hearing about these on Dr. Oz, I decided to give them a try. They are pretty much what I expected. Others have compared these to WASA crispbread, but at least WASA puts a little salt, rye, oat bran or some other ingredient to make them more palatable. I know these are good for me, but when I'm looking for a snack I seem to bypass these more than not. Maybe GG company could add something to make these a bit more tasty.

review/summary: These do NOT taste good, but they do fill you up.
review/text: These are not a tasty little snack to help you stay on your diet.  They taste terrible.  The first time I tried one, I couldn't believe that they were actually identified as food.  As a friend of mine said, "these don't even taste like they are supposed to be edible."  I was motivated to lose weight, so I ate them with peanut butter or almond butter.  After a couple of weeks of losing weight, I could eat them straight with a large glass of water.  Don't get me wrong, I still do not think that they taste good, but they are edible, with some effort and patience.  More importantly, they really work.  I've lost 30 pounds and have 15 left to go, so I'll be buying one more case or so.

review/summary: Good with right topping
review/text: If you need more fiber in your diet I recommend these. They are NOT good by themselves and are quite dry. With that being said I follow a fairly strict (no fun/boring) diet and find these help me with fiber and to satisfy my need for crunch. This will likely sound gross to many but my favorite way to eat them is drizzled with sugar free pancake syrup, a little cinnamon and topped with a big pile of cottage cheese - LOVE this! I also spread peanut butter on top or  a laughing cow blue cheese triangle. For 12 calories and 2 net carbs these are a great base for a low cal snack.

For festive occasions add a tiny ort of butter!<br /><br />As others have mentioned, you can add toppings.  Just chewing one of these is an exercise.  But it's not a bad one.<br /><br />Getting older is sometimes about making prudent decisions about what to put in your body.

review/summary: Barely tolerable
review/text: I bought a pack of these crackers at Whole Foods Market.  The cracker tastes awful by itself.  I honestly could not have ate a whole one dry.  I covered the remaining part of the cracker with a thin layer of peanut butter and it became tolerable.<br /><br />I agree with the other posters that you need to drink water with these crackers after every bite because they're dry.  As advertised, they do help tame the appetite, so that's a plus. However, I'm not sure if it's the cracker alone, if it's the cracker in combination with all the water or if the terrible taste tricks the body out of hunger.<br /><br />Because I already have a package, I'll continue to eat the remaining crackers with peanut butter as long as they haven't passed their expiration date.  But at this point, I don't think I'll buy another package (but stranger things could happen).

review/summary: "My new love" A low-carbers memoir
review/text: 4 words: GG crisps, peanut butter, no sugar smuckers jam (has splenda) and real butter. De....friggin...licious. I just bought these little slices of heaven from netrition and tried them out using the previously mentioned ingredients (and in that order too) about 3 minutes ago. Thrilled. I'm just thrilled. I bought them at netrition, but with the shipping costs, it's actually cheaper to buy them here, if you get the free shipping. Let's get one thing straight. I would never eat these things if I was not on a low carb diet. They were not meant to shoot your dopamine levels through the roof while eating them, if you know what I mean. But if you've got problems "going", or if you're on a low carb diet and need a pretty decent alternative to the cracker, or if you just like throwing packages of health foods in people's faces and telling them how much healthier you are then them, these are the crackers for you. I just plan on using them for LC diet purposes. You won't be disappointed.

They honestly aren't bad topped with peanut butter (I use Jif natural) or cream cheese. For a low carb PB&J, try with the peanut butter and a sliced strawberry on top, it's awesome! I think spreads are the best, but you can top it with anything. My mom breaks it up and uses it as cereal. Be creative!

review/summary: 5 crackers with strawberry topping = 25g fiber, ~120cal, 10 net carbs! Delicious! Happy customer! Completely calmed anxietytoeat
review/text: I bought this at the local health store near where I live but I came to Amazon to leave a review for others to read.<br /><br />I read the reviews on amazon and when I bought this (paid $3.50/pack there) I knew it would taste like cardboard - well - it's true - it tastes like cardboard! It was very difficult to finish eating one single cracker, and when I went to the second I just could not - it was impossible to eat the cracker by itself.<br /><br />I then ran out to the supermarket and bought Sugar Free Smucker's Strawberry Topping (2tbsp = 25cal, 0 net carbs, 9 sugar alcohols,0 fat, 0mg sodium, 0 protein), and in a matter of a few minutes I had already eaten 5 of these crackers! Delicious!!!<br /><br />Each cracker is 2 net carbs (and 12cal), so 2x5 = 10 net carbs, 25g fiber, 60cal (only downside of this combination is that it is too delicious and it's hard to put down the darn crackers/topping!!!).<br /><br />After eating them, it completely calmed my hunger (I WAS genuinely hungry). Don't buy this at Amazon because of the shipping cost, so get them at your local health food store instead, but don't eat them w/o a topping.<br /><br />Conclusion: if you eat one cracker by itself, it'll destroy your appetite or any cravings you have - it does taste like cardboard though. But, if you add a carb-free sweet topping or any other topping of your choice, you're in for a fantastic low-carb snack, packed with fiber!<br /><br />I am currently in Ketosis (I am on a ketogenic diet) and this works for us wanting to stay on a 20-30 carb diet. But even after I'm done cutting weight (I'm only 10-15lbs away from a perfectly flat abdomen!) I'll still buy these because they are so ridiculously nutritious (0 fat, 0 cholesterol, 30mg sodium per cracker, 2 nt carbs, 5 fiber, 1g protein).<br /><br />This product makes an excellent addition to my low-carb/carb-free foods in my kitchen (includes breads/tortillas).<br /><br />I can't believe for 5 crackers and 4 servings of the strawberry topping, I consumed 25g fiber for just about 120 calories and 10 net carbs!!!<br /><br />Happy with this! (P.S.: I wish GG created a carb-free crispbread).

review/summary: mild and crispy, but  too harsh on digestive tract
review/text: My first impression of these crackers was that they kinda looked like some sort of fiberboard and tasted  funny.  At the second tasting, I decided they tasted okay, just mildly like rye.  I liked the crisp crunchiness of them.  So the second impression was good.  However, an hour later I found they did not agree with my digestive tract.  I only ate a half of one, but all that day every time I ate something I would feel overly full even though I didn't overeat.  I wonder if there is some unlisted ingredient in them that does more than bran to make you feel full, because why would that effect happen at the next meal when none of it was eaten? Maybe bran can have that effect.  I don't know.  Anyway, I would suggest trying someone else's or buying the smallest amount possible to see if these 'agree' with you as well as to see if you like them.  Also, try no more than half a cracker at first to see how your body reacts.

I mean anyone can tell by doing just a little research these are dry and tasteless on their own and many tell you to add topping.<br /><br />So I ordered the 5 pack and knew what to expect and was NOT surprised..actually I was a little, they weren't as bad as I thought they'd be.<br /><br />My two teenagers and I tried them when they came in today. We topped 3 crackers with a thin smear of cream cheese and a little diced onion and than we each grabbed a cracker and tried it. It gave us that crunchy feeling we had been missing since going on Atkins and the toppings helped even more.<br /><br />So we will keep them and add more low carb toppings as we experiment with them.

Remember folks, you are eating 85% unprocessed wheat bran, bran flour, and a teeny bit of salt!  Its not bad, but not awful!<br /><br />That said, I've eaten them on the go, straight up and like the crunch.  They are good with strong flavored spreads, especially. They do fill you up very well when paired with a good source of protein.<br /><br />If you are use to eating bran flakes in the morning for breakfast and like it, you will enjoy these.  That said, if bran flakes are not for you, these wont be either.<br /><br />  These crisps are great for low-carbers, vegans, people doing the HCG diet, and diabetics.<br /><br />  Or if you just want a boost of fiber!

I spread a thin layer of peanut butter on a wafer. Then I spread another layer of Nuttella on top of the peanut butter.

They are VERY dry & flavorless & not in a good way.<br /><br />I thought they would be a little less tasty than the high fiber crackers at the store, but no...they're way worse, but I guess that should be expected at just 12 calories.  First I tried them with laughing cow blue cheese & the flavors didn't go well at all.  Then I tried them with veggie dip (made with 16oz light sour cream & 1 pack of Cugino's veggie weggie dip mix).  This was at least edible.  I have some PB2 on order to try it with & update my review if it's better.<br /><br />Right now, I wouldn't buy them again, but at least I only paid $6.69 for a 5-pack through Amazon with subscribe & save & a $3 coupon.

review/summary: THEY'RE EXTREME!!
review/text: I just opened the box last night while waiting for dinner.  The crackers are dense with a good bitey texture. The first bite I ate plain, and it was like eating sand. FIRST TIMERS, DO NOT EAT THEM PLAIN; YOU WILL BE TURNED OFF!  I hurried to get some almond butter on the cracker.  That was fabulous. I plan on eating these daily as part of a weight management plan. Right now I am eating these crackers SOLELY for the nutritional benefits and absolutely NOT FOR THE TASTE. But they are edible and are supposed to be really good for you. I hope so...

review/summary: Move a ton of food with minimal calories.
review/text: I have to be honest... I was on the fence about these for a while before I finally bought them and now I gotta say I'm happy I did.  On their own they are a bit barky in flavor (there really is not nice term for mashed bran in the form of a dense cracker).  I have since learned to put some low calorie jam on them or put them in my salads and they are extremely functional.  You can have a few of these with some jam and get a very low calorie snack that is backed up with a lot of fiber (nice for all you Weight Watchers out there).  So you have to put this into context.  You are buying bran crackers, pure & simple that have next to no calories.  Don't expect more than you are buying.

review/text: I have been using these for years. They are so versatile, absorbent (great with sugar free syrups), and function in every type of recipe imaginable: sweet or savory. I rarely use them as crackers. They are great in "protein ice cream shakes", crumbled in so they can soak up the flavor. They add a great crunch to anything you put them in, from salads to puddings. I highly recommend these.

review/text: I ordered these elsewhere because I didn't want to be stuck with several packages in case I didn't like them.  If you're doing Atkins or another low carb plan and have been missing crunchy crackers, this may be just what you're looking for.  The taste is not bad but as  other reviewers have mentioned, these crispbreads are extremely dry.  You have got to put something on them - butter, cream cheese, jam, anything and you should have a beverage with them too.  If you consider them to be a vehicle for great toppings, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Low calorie, 2 net carbs per slice, plenty of fiber and crunch.  What's not to like?

Also good with laughing cow cheese, cherry tomatoes, salt and pepper. They definitely need something sweet or savory on top or else they are pretty bland but it's the perfect base.

review/text: I'm at the age, a mere 61 years old, my digestive system has gone a bit out of whack.  I have to regularly consume extra fiber to keep my "output" at a good consistency.  GG fiber crackers to the rescue.  I notice a big negative difference when I go off the crackers for a few days.  I had to learn to befriend them, I admit.  After eating my first one plain, out of the package, I knew I had to come up with a better way to get these things down.  My routine of late has been to have a cracker every other day, with light cream cheese and jelly, or broken up and used as crackers in my soup.  Peanut butter is good also.  An added plus is that these crackers are only 12 calories with no fat or sugar.  A dieters delight.

review/text: I use to buy the bran crispbread in my health food store but never realized the possibilities that they offered from pie crust to pizza. Discovering the possabilities I now have them delivered monthly. They are awesome with hot foods or cold and they soften with moist spreads when allowed to sit for a while. For those on special diets they are a low glycemic index food, low calorie and high fiber. At first try people may cringe because of the abundant fiber and dryness. The trick with this high fiber item is to eat them with another food and or beverage even if it's just water. The beauty of this food is their health giving properties. They work inside out.

review/summary: Nutritious, but not too tasty
review/text: I ordered this product because I was looking for a cracker with high fiber and low carbohydrates.  This product has both, and it is very filling.  It goes well with any topping.  However, it is VERY fibrous and dry, and not very tasty.  I find myself taking very small bites, just so I don't have to consume a lot of fluid with each bite.  If you have chronic consipation, like I do. . .eating two of these crackers daily will surely cure your problem!  The benefits of this product do outweigh the fact that they don't taste very good, so I will continue to purchase them.  The taste and texture take a little getting used to, though.

It's great for a late night snack or I pack one for lunch for a mini-sandwich.  I top it with anything from peanut butter, nutella, mustard or bologna.  Whether sweet or savory, you can use it for whatever snack you like.  I just lost quite a bit of weight and this is one item I really don't have to worry about the calories - only 12 each!  Highly recommend it.  Is it dry?  Yes, indeed, but with a beverage (tea, water, etc) it's just fine.  I'm ready to purchase again.

Tried to make it taste better by dipping it in milk, coffee, or tea and imagining it to be cookies. It worked until I put it in my mouth, and I am pretty sure that my uvula went into throes of spasms, and my tongue refused to taste anything else for the rest of the day.<br /><br />But it is good for you...

review/summary: Like eating pressboard
review/text: I ordered these because Dr Oz said they were a good source of fiber and they help you feel full. As soon as they arrived I tried one. OMG, it was like eating a mouth full of compressed wood. Tried it again with a little almond butter (also Dr. Oz recommendation) Didn't help. These things are ghastly! Would still eat them if they helped me feel full, but that didn't work for me either. I'll stick with quaker rice cakes as a snack. I actually like those.

review/summary: Best Caribbean Style Hot Sauce
review/text: I lived in the Caribbean for a number of years and tried many hot sauces from the region. Miss Anna's is the best. It's not the hottest - not even close - but do not be fooled. It is still plenty hot. Caribbean hot sauces are generally several degrees hotter than Mexican, US Tobasco-styled ones or commercial Asian varieties. One too many shakes will induce hiccups and copious head sweats. What sets Miss Anna's apart is the flavor profile of scotch bonnets, garlic, saltiness and curry spices and the near perfect balance of those flavors. Once you have rice and peas with Miss Anna's you will never want it without.

It has moved Melinda's to the second place spot on my top ten list of favorite hot sauces. Miss Anna's Hot Pepper Sauce packs plenty of heat while providing maximum flavor. Highly recommended.

review/text: February 14, 2012<br /><br />To: D&S Office Supply and Amazon.Com,<br /><br />I would like to retract my previous review, as I believe that I jumped the gun. I received a defective bag of candy. Thinking that it would be taken care of in just a few days was unrealistic as this company does a lot of business and responded within a reasonable amount of time. They not only sent me a replacement bag but they sent two bags.<br /><br />I feel terrible for assuming that I was going to get taken, that was thoughtless of me. Amazon does an excellent, AAA job of protecting our purchases against fraud while assuring the highest level of quality and customer service.<br /><br />I would like to not only retract my last review and complaint, but apologize to D&S Office Supply and Amazon.Com for my hasty complaint. It was most certainly unfounded!<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />W. Woodward

review/text: Ordinarily I do not drink sweet coffee, and all the iced k-cups I've tried have been gooey and bitter. I tried this one when Green Mountain had a special, and now I'm ordering more for my daughter! It is very sweet, and makes a relatively small amount (the "iced" setting on my Cuisinart brewer is sends only 4 ozs. over the ice, and I wouldn't recommend more than 5-6 cubes in the glass). But brewed that way you get a refreshing, sweet, nutty drink. It's really rather strong this way, and has a surprising caffeine kick, which I don't get from my hot hazelnut brew. With record-breaking temps in Atlanta this year, it's a welcomed treat!

review/text: I prefer iced tea and I picked this tea up the last time I was in the US and liked it a lot. I've switched from black to green tea because of the health benefits I've read about with green tea.<br /><br />I can also find this particular tea in Mexico, which rocks because good non-herbal teas are hard to find.<br /><br />The directions state that for iced tea, you should brew 4 bags per quart, which is probably accurate, but I just use it with cold water the way you would for sun tea and it takes a few hours, but it works just fine with a lot less hassle. Try it that way, I've had excellent luck with it.  Anything that will cut yet another step out of my day is great. :D<br /><br />Do I think that this is the best green tea ever? I'm sure it's not. I don't find it at all bitter the way some green teas can be and it is definitely priced right. Please refer to other reviewers for how it tastes hot, because I honestly can't speak to that.

The tea brews great in hot water, and produces great flavor.  I do have to admit I add a bit of honey to my tea for sweetness - but I have a sweet tooth :)

review/summary: Putting the ginger back in ginger ale!
review/text: I know, I know. These reviews are nothing but memories, but I can't help it! If I can drink a tasty drink that is good for me, gives me energy, and makes me think of happy things, well, why wouldn't I? This one is all my grandmother and my father. Every Thanksgiving, my grandmother would let us drink cranberry juice mixed with ginger ale, and we felt so grown up. So grown up! It's still my preferred way of drinking cranberry juice, and when the cranberry ginger ale is released around the holidays, all I do is think of her. Her son, my father, is a ginger ale memory for me too, it's his favorite soft drink. Vernor's, if you've got it, or Schweppes, but Canada Dry will do in a pinch and make him think of me anyway. When my wife is ill, it's ginger ale, if you please, not lemon-lime anything. You know that old adage that girls always search for someone like their father? It's so true in my case...my wife and my father are amazingly alike. So when I spotted it on the Red Leaf tea website, I had to grab it for my campaign to get her to like ginger ale. Who knows, I might convert my dad with it when he comes up to visit next!<br /><br />This is wonderful. Ginger and I are not the best of buddies, but I'm coming around to it. This reminds me of a local ginger ale found only in Middle Kentucky called "Ale-8-1". It's full of ginger flavor, but in a very good way. If you get this one, don't be put off by the overwhelming ginger smell, it's not nearly as strong as it smells, which is a good thing to me. It would definitely be a matcha I reach for when I'm headed into work with an upset stomach, but need a pick me up. I don't think it's one I'll keep in stock, but it's not one I'll be actively trying to swap away either. I'm excited to try it with the cranberry. If you're familiar with ginger ale brands, it's more of a Vernor's than anything else. Lord have mercy, I spend way too much time with ginger ale, apparently. But if I can talk my Dad into trying matcha, this will definitely be the one I lead with. Who knows, my father in law greatly enjoyed the French Vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea, maybe my dad can be won over as well!

review/summary: organo gold cafe latte
review/text: I am very fond of this coffee enough so that I am willing to go a bit out of my way to get it. At first the idea of instant coffee turned me off since usually I brew my own, but I like the taste of the coffee and how it makes me feel.  I am not experiencing any jitters and find the ganoderma invigorating.  It is easy to make and I would recommend this product.  The company I ordered this with shipped it here to Hawaii within a few days.

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: I personally don't drink coffee, but if I did it would be Organo. I tasted it, and I can see why people are addicted to the stuff. But as soon as my mother is running out of this product. she will not leave me alone (Call/text/Carrier Pigeon etc...), till I show her proof that I order it from Amazon.

review/summary: Will Buy These Again
review/text: My dog loves these raw hides [ok so she loves any raw hide] but I love that they are rolled nice and tight and are not filled with little pieces.  The ones I buy in the stores tend to have lots of loose pieces in the roll and I'm afraid my dog will choke on them.  These are great and the price is decent too.

review/summary: Worst Possible Choice Of Rawhide
review/text: Nature's Choice Natural Rawhide are the worst rawhide I have ever made the mistake of buying. They are loosely rolled with lots of little pieces that splinter when the dog gets to the center. They seem also to be more air than anything else. My Pup is able to completely finish one of these in around 20 minutes.  Really If youre looking for rawhide look elsewhere.

review/summary: Waste of money
review/text: I have 2 miniature Schnauzers so admittedly they are voracious chewers which is why I buy these large rolls.  These are large rolls in appearance but they lack substance - not tightly wrapped, almost hollow and lightweight.  I give each dog a roll and they are devoured in about an hour.  Is it too much to ask for someone to sell tough "natural" rawhide rolls that last for hours?  This brand is not cost efficient and I cannot recommend.
