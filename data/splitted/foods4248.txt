review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

review/summary: Lightly salted, yet tasty
review/text: This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.<br /><br />They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.<br /><br />They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table.

review/summary: Great strong flavor
review/text: I agree with the company motto "A Natural Obsession".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips.

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

review/summary: 4 Stars for price and taste
review/text: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.

review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010.

review/summary: Fast, Easy and Tasty
review/text: My mother loved the processed foods of the 70's.  Consequently, I ate a lot of hamburger and tuna helper!  Thiry years later, I still like them, but prefer a more healthful version.  These Amy's fit the bill.  If you are in a pinch for time, and can't make homemade tuna caserole, you just need to whip out a pan and have this made in minutes.  Nice to buy in bulk because my local stores don't always carry it.

review/text: Quick, easy, healthy, and EVERYBODY in my family likes it!  It tastes 10 times better than Tuna Helper, with the same amount of effort and ZERO guilt!!  If I sound overly excited, it's because I am.  My grocery store stopped carrying this item over a year ago, and I've been unable to find it locally anywhere.  I never thought about Amazon when I thought about food.  Two cases (I'm sharing with a friend) and free shipping!! Comes out to about $2.50 per box.  Cannot recommend enough!

review/summary: A great way to get some fish in people who don't like fish!
review/text: This stuff is fantastic. Extremely affordable for an organic product, and with the tuna you're getting Omega 3 as well. And it only takes 10-12 minutes to make! My very picky husband loves this.<br /><br />Here's what you'll need (besides this box of yummies):<br /><br /> - 1 can of tuna (box says 6 oz., but I use 8 oz.)<br /> - 1 tablespoon of butter<br /> - 1 cup of milk<br /><br />The instructions are on the box so I'm not going to repeat it, but it involves combining everything in a 12-inch skillet and heating for 10-12 minutes. The only tricky thing about making it is not allowing it to boil over before you put the tuna and pasta in. Here's how I avoid that:<br /><br /> - Add the butter, water, and milk together in the skillet. Make sure the skillet is at least 12 inches wide, or it really won't fit.<br /> - Heat to medium-high heat and watch it. DON'T LEAVE! Once it starts boiling, it will boil over FAST because of the milk.<br /> - Right before it starts boiling, the milk should begin to simmer around the edges. Immediately reduce the heat to medium and add the seasoning pouch. Stir that in first, then add your tuna and pasta. Stir it well before you add the pasta and tuna to try and get as many chunks out as you can.<br /> - If it stopped boiling, increase the heat to medium-high again and watch it until it just begins to boil. Reduce heat back down to medium and let it do its thing for 10-12 minutes.<br /><br />The box says to cover it, but I don't. Instead I leave it uncovered and stir it once at the 5-minute mark.<br /><br />Definitely let it sit for 3 minutes off the heat. This will allow the sauce to thicken nicely, otherwise it will be a little runny.

review/summary: Easy, More Healthful "Helper"
review/text: This Annie's mix makes a quick, healthy meal on busy nights. Basically you're getting a mildly seasoned white sauce and good quality rotini. It's fine as is but adding some herbs, a dash of worcestershire sauce and/or some grated cheese makes it better. We've substituted salmon and even ham for the tuna on occasion. Portions for serving four are on the small side.

So, when I curl up on the sofa in front of my fire, I am guilt free, especially since this tea is as good for your body as it is for your spirit!!<br /><br />Get several boxes, so you don't run out.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LO30Q">Choice Organic - Organic Tea - Northwest Blackberry, 6 Units / 20 bag</a>

review/text: This is my second order of this tea because my daughter took several boxes back to college with her even though she is a loose-leaf tea snob. So refreshing hot or cold. No fake flavor like so many of the fruity teas seem to have. Love that it is organic and no caffeine which were among my main reasons for trying it. When someone is over and not sure which tea to have it is the one I always suggest. Everyone loves it. Needs no sweetening because it is so flavorful on its own. I leave the teabag in my giant mug for more flavor. If you use a 'normal' sized cup you could probably get two or even three steepings from it.

review/text: Let me for the sake of fairness begin this review by stating that I and my family like our drinks very strong.  That said, it takes three or four of these bags to make a proper quart of sunbrewed tea, and then I still feel like it lacks real tea flavor, so I usually throw in a black or iced blend bag on top of those.  The blackberry flavor is very nice though - it is NOT sugary sweet.  Also, for those of us who like pretty food, the color is really beautiful when this is sitting in a glass pitcher.  :)

review/summary: Best For The Finicky Cat
review/text: I have one of those cats that seems to know instinctively when I attempt to get a store brand or cheap dry cat past his nose.  He'll eat just about anything from the name brand section of the pet food aisle, but turn turn on one paw and ignore anything that is generic.  I usually try to get him some variety.  9 Lives, Friskies, Purina..etc.  He'll chow on them all.  But if I had to pick one that he seems to lick his chops at more than an other it has to be this kit kaboodle.  He laps it up so fast I sometimes think he is sneaking it out of the house for the feline black market.  Kit Kaboodle is just a smidgen more than some of the other name brands.  Not enough to be a major factor in any cat owners decision.  So if you are looking for the very best and tastiest, my vote would go to Kit Kaboodle.  Give it a try and then ask your own cat...

review/summary: Some of the Best Tea I've Ever Had
review/text: I used to live in Taipei, Taiwan. From my time there, I think I can tell you what good tea is, and it sure is hard to find back here. All too often beverage companies kill their bottled teas by adding way too much sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Honest Tea's Honey Green Tea has just the perfect amount of sweetness. I realize the most authentic way of drinking tea is to drink it fresh-brewed (preferably loose-leaf) with nothing added, but alas, I can't drink my tea that way. I wish I did though. For those of us who gotta have our tea with a pinch of sugar, this is the closest to the stuff I enjoyed back in Taiwan, and boy do they have some excellent tea there.

review/summary: Diet Saver!!  Perfect Size Dessert!
review/text: A friend introduced me to these about 6 months ago, and they have become a staple ever since. My weakness is dessert. I can stick to my diet all day long, but in the evening I MUST have some type of baked, preferably chocolate, dessert. I was having a very hard time finding something to fit the bill, satisfy my sweet tooth and still stay on track - sorry those 100 cal cookie packs were not cutting it lol. I had feared that these would taste 'fake', but surprisingly they are very yummy! They are so much better and easier than the "No Pudge" mix. Completely hit the spot, leaving me satisfied, especially during that time of the month. I like to add fresh strawberries and some ff/sf cool whip for a real decadent low calorie treat. Couple tablespoons of water, and 35 seconds in the micro and voila!<br />I am so happy Amazon finally started carrying these. When I can find them, I usually pay $2.49-$2.99 each a pack. These work out a tad cheaper. I have also tried the larger sized ones and believe it or not, they are a little too rich and 3 quarters the way through I got that "ate too much/sick" feeling. I definitely appreciate these for the single serving size - makes my cheating guilt free.

review/summary: Death of My Diet
review/text: I know other reviews have stated the Warm Delight Minis have been diet savers (due to the portion control).  NOT FOR ME.  These things are delicious little cups of fudgy goodness, and I've found I have very little in the way of self-control when it comes to them.  I bought a bunch of the molten chocolate and the caramel cakes, and with all that sweet deliciousness stacked in my cupboard, I was eating a dessert after every meal.<br /><br />However, the size is perfect for a single-serving dessert.  I've found that I would get sick of eating the bigger warm delights, because I would start to find them too sweet and sticky about half-way through, and throw away a good portion (they're really not as good when they're cold).  So, these Minis are perfect... at this size, you don't get sick of having too much of something overly-sweet, but you still get a nice chocolate dessert.

review/summary: Beware monoliths bearing gifts (of chocolate)
review/text: Okay -- so 6 months ago I gave up red meat and poultry for both health and environmental reasons.  Then 3 months ago I upped my % of fresh foods daily to about 75%.  And I'm buying organic dairy and veg/fruit.  And baking my own hi-fiber bread with organic flour.  And I've lost about 27lbs -- without much pain and suffering.<br /><br />But I gotta tell you -- these little tiny dishes (which are NOT biodegradable, though the comparable cornstarch dishes are available...) which amount to about 6 small bites and still contain ingredients Betty Crocker should be ashamed to market to an already allergic, asthmatic, obese, and energy guzzling population --<br /><br />well, they're actually good.  Easy.  Fast.  Limited serving size.  Better if you add about 1/2t of real cocoa powder (emphasize REAL -- like Dagoba organic which you can get online from World Wide Chocolate....)<br /><br />If I were Queen, I'd just have Dagoba make these, use the cornstarch environmentally friendly bowls, and no nasty little preservatives and less than healthy fats.<br /><br />Try these at your own peril.  Betty Crocker should be shot.

review/summary: Excellant soda, but horrible price and S&H
review/text: Wow .... its difficult to give this review taking in all factors.  IBC makes the best root beer and cream soda I have ever tasted, IMHO.  I had to take off one star because they are trying to sell it for $43 a case, when I buy it at SAM's Club for $10 a case. Also, I had to take off another star for the S&H, $22.49, are you kidding me. I could buy a couple of cases, pay tax plus the time of driving to pick it up and still come out ahead than ordering it here.<br />I have shopped Amazon.com for several years and literally spent a couple grand, but this price is utterly ridiculous.  The soda itsself deserves 5 stars plus a glass bottle keeps it colder than a can.<br />I highly recommend the product, but shop elsewhere.

review/summary: The great Australian condiment and beer by-product
review/text: Vegemite, the great Australian condiment and beer by-product.  This is a jar of vegemite.  Real vegemite, not that half-strength new stuff.  Not a big jar, but with Vegemite, a little goes a long way.  Really.  There is even a rumour that no non-Australian has ever finished a jar.  Also, don't worry about the expiry date.  Vegemite never goes off, even keeping it in a cupboard in the heat of an Australian summer, so you do think the sub-Arctic conditions of Europe or the USA will have any impact on it?  Nuclear waste will decay faster than this stuff.<br /><br />Alright, so you have your jar of vegemite.  Advanced users can find recipes involving vegemite as a dip, in cooking with meat, etc.  But if you are an advanced user, why read a review?  Walk away from the computer and go and eat some vegemite right now.  For you interested novices, here goes:<br /><br />1.  Buy vegemite.<br />2.  Eat vegemite, preferably on buttered toast or grilled with cheese.<br /><br />Step 2 probably needs a little explanation.<br /><br />Vegemite is not peanut butter, or marmalade.  It is best used in moderation.  Very moderate moderation.  So get your slice of bread, and toast it if you wish.  Spread butter on it - as thickly as you like.  This is vital, both to cut the richness of the vegemite, and also to act a lubricant (spreading vegemite on dry toast or bread is a recipe for disaster - just because it resembles engine oil does not mean it has the same physical properties).  Now, get a little vegemite on a knife.  Less than that.  Probably a third or half what you started with.  You only need enough to faintly discolour the butter with a brownish tinge.  Do the same thing with another slice of bread, or just fold over the one you have to make a sandwich.<br /><br />Now eat the sandwich.  Vegemite is an acquired taste, but its not too hard to pick up.  Remember, we feed this stuff to infants in Australia - and they love it.  Try it with both toast and plain bread.<br /><br />If you can't enjoy a vegemite sandwich, there is one more thing to try: a vegemite and cheddar cheese sandwich (Don't try using Brie, or any fancy cheese for that matter).  Its best using toast, and then spread vegemite as above.  Slice the cheese quite thinly - about 1/16th of an inch - and lay over the top.  Leave the sandwich open and grill in the over until the cheese bubbles.  Remove, let cool slightly, and eat.  Its best on a cold rainy day -but good anytime.<br /><br />If you like that, you can build up to using more vegemite on your butter.  But always be careful, as mistakes have been made by those who thought they ready to try more and more vegemite.  Some will even talk about the experience; most never will.<br /><br />Vegemite is a great source of vitamin B, and tastes yeasty and salty, in an indescribable sort of way.  It has to be tasted to be understood.

review/summary: Be A Little Adventuresome
review/text: I'm not from Australia where Vegemite is so popular but I heard the song "Down Under" and always wondered what Vegemite was. I found out that its a yeast product made from the process of beer brewing. What I was intrigued about is that it is vegetarian but with a beef flavor. I ordered it through Amazon's Marketplace and here it came all the way from Britain. I spread some on a piece of bread and decided immediately that it was an acquired taste, but then again after a few days I found myself using it fairly often especially on crackers. Well, my wife started putting it in soups and that really cinched my love for it. It's very good for you and a new taste sensation to try if you like being a little adventuresome.

review/summary: Call me a convert
review/text: I was frightened by my breakfast today. Vegemite on buttered toast. Yes, I had researched the traditional way to eat it. But still... I was scared. I faced my fear. I opened the jar. I stared down the thick, dark, brown, gooey goo. I took a spoon and took control. I spooned out a tiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnny bit. Tiny. I put it on the edge of my toast. I made a face. I took a bite. I smiled. In dismay. In pleasure. I picked up the spoon again and commanded the brown goo to give me more more more. Well, still sparingly, but, nevertheless... more. I used no more than 1/2 teaspoon on my slice of toast. I had a second slice with another almost 1/2 teaspoon. I updated my Facebook status. People replied in curiosity, in fellowship or in disgust. Or all of the above. About an hour later I craved it again, and I indulged again. Between waking and dinnertime, three slices with that just-less-than-one-half-teaspoonful of Vegemite was all I consumed, and, I swear, I was pleasantly satiated all day and full of energy. Can't wait until breakfast tomorrow! :) (Standard disclaimer: I've been vegetarian for almost 18 years. This had an almost beefy taste. Salty, beefy, vegan, lots of B vitamins. Yum.)

I've even spread it on a purchased veggie sandwich and the Vegemite really kicks it up quite a bit. Aussies had quite a good idea when they came up with this spread. Thanks, mates!!

review/summary: Insta-love at first taste
review/text: So... I've known about Vegemite for at least 10 years now.  But than again, who really hasn't heard about it when they browse forums and surf the social media websites?  Sadly, I've not tried it until two days ago.<br /><br />I decided that as part of my process of getting ready to emigrate so I could be with my aussie girlfriend, I really should try some of the more well-known foods that simply are not common up here.  Started with some searching, only to find that it's very expensive to ship even from retailers within the continental US, so I did some investigating where I could purchase it locally.  Found out that Fred Meyers carries it, albeit only in the 150g jar and in the baking section next to the marzipan of all things.  Brought it home and had to try it before I did much else after getting the perishable groceries in the fridge.  I first tried it by itself and enjoyed the flavour, proceeded to spread it on toast and was in bliss.  (I'd personally recommend trying it on hot buttered toast for the average person.) The next morning I tried it with butter on toast and was in ecstasy.  Ended up bringing it to work so I could enjoy the smell and enhance the aroma of the coffee. (Why do I need to drink coffee outside of the flavour now?)<br /><br />I just tried it in a peanut butter, Vegemite, and butter toasted sandwich that utterly knocks the socks off the best sharp cheddar toasted sandwich that I've had without a doubt.  The fact that I left it on one side too long so that it started carbonising didn't matter.<br /><br />I can't wait to cook with it and use it more now that I've found my local World Market to carry the 220g jar for only a bit more!<br /><br />Absolute pros:<br />* It tastes beyond awesome!<br />* The aftertaste is excellent and lasts for hours, yet doesn't leave you with a bad breath.<br />* Extremely versatile.<br />* Energises your body and mind.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* You need to warm up your knife a bit before spreading it when it's cold out.  This makes it far easier to spread without having to spread it only on hot toast immediately after it's left the griddle or if you don't desire to microwave the Vegemite.  You may be able to spread it directly on bread that's not been toasted if it's a sturdy loaf at this point too.  I found that holding the tip of the knife against the griddle until the knife is a bit warmer than your fingers to be an excellent way to do so.<br />* The 2.5kg tub isn't available in stores up in my area.<br /><br />You'll prolly like it if you enjoy:<br />* Salty and savoury foods.<br />* Ample levels of brewers yeast in your foods or the flavour/smell of the brewers yeast.<br />* Peanut butter and garlic salt sandwiches.<br />* Toasted sharp yellow cheddar sandwiches.<br />* Smoked yellow cheddar.<br /><br />Thank you mum for raising me on a diet heavy in brewers yeast! :D

I don't recommend you buy a large jar at first; believe me it won't go fast at first.

review/text: I love the 'mites'. Vegemite, marmite and promite. Vegemite is an acquired taste, so it's not something I recommend trying unles you know what you're in for. It's a beer by-product and it's loaded with vitamin Bs, totally vegetarian and great on toast. If you like sweet and salty things, I recommend trying it on cinnamon raisen toast, or even pikelets or scones, if you're game. Some people use it to add flavor to casseroles and for an added vitamin boost, I'm sure it would be great.<br /><br />The product was just the same as I would purchase in a New Zealand store (even though it's Australian). Would I recommend it? I did mention that it's an acquired taste right? Go easy spreading it on your toast. A thick coating is not recommended.<br /><br />So, if you can't find it locally, yes buy it here. It's cheaper if you can find an international food store and save on the shipping.

Vegemite and chopped walnuts on bread. Grilled cheese and vegemite, on and on it is so multi useful.

review/text: Go to my review list for a review of this thing (for some reason the same product pops up on different pages and I don't want to post the same thing several times). It's a very nice condiment with the main flavour being salty.<br /><br />However the prices here are mind-blowing: would you pay ten bucks (plus oversized shipping) for a bottle of soy sauce? Probably not, and neither should you pay for this thing, especially considering how tiny this jar is. Btw, still overpriced, it ia available at Wegman's for slightly over six bucks. Still too much, but less than a half of what I see they're asking for here. Don't buy into hype and snobbery and don't overpay: this is nothing terribly special, just a kind of salt, basically; slightly bitter and with a lot of vitamin B in it. This jar should really cost less than a dollar and be available in grocery stores.<br /><br />Btw, Wegman's also has Marmite, which is very similar to Vegemite; for under five bucks for the same amount; Marmite is also available in Whole Foods, though more expensively: over seven bucks a pop).

review/text: I haven't liked a lot of these 7.5 oz micro bowls(most of the chefboyardee) but was pleased with this. There was a good amount of meat & veggies with not to much liquid. A slice of bread & butter & I'm all set. Gave 4 stars because like all of these I've tried the lid is really hard for me to get off. Especially with arthritic hands.

review/summary: We like it
review/text: Good portion size (7.5 oz), not too carb-heavy for a diabetic, reasonable nutritional value, just enough to satisfy hunger when paired with a small sandwich for lunch. Good amount of meat, gravy is a little blah but it's canned food, really. Good price bought in bulk online. Glad it comes in this size, would say that it's part of a good cold-day-take-to-work meal.

review/summary: Would not recommend
review/text: I had purchased this dog jerky from Petsmart and my dog love it.  Then when Petsmart no longer sold it I ordered from Amazon.  Not sure what happened but it with in a few weeks of my purchase it was fuzzy with mold.  I threw both containers out before I had a chance to open them.

review/summary: Even carnivores like these...
review/text: While walking in the West Village  searching for a nutritious snack, I came upon raw crunch bars.  The juice bar I strolled into didn't have much of a selection, so I was pleasantly surprised how delicious it was!  I immediately  googled the company and ordered boxes of the different favors.  Athiough goji is my favorite , the medley of seeds and nuts  with just the right amount of sweetness, makes every flavor satisfying.  Even my husband, the carnivore, likes them and so will you.

review/summary: not that great
review/text: I was excited to try this after all the good reviews.... but seriously, why is everyone making a big deal about them? I'm not even a picky-eater, but these taste so boring. I rather just eat a handful of seeds and nuts on their own, rather than this weird combination put into a bar.

review/summary: Finally a GREAT low sugar, gluten free nutrition bar
review/text: With a diabetic family history, a gluten intolerance and recent recovery from Candida,  I have been searching for a delicious nutrition bar that I can eat.<br />I just recently discovered the Raw Crunch Organic Bar at my local coffee shop and was so pleased. It is scrumptious. It has no gluten, very low in sugar, is loaded with protein and nutrients .... and it is organic!  My thanks to the founders of Raw Crunch Bars!  I just ordered a case for my upcoming 7 day trip on the Boundary Waters.
