review/summary: Not too weak, not too strong, it's juuuuuust right
review/text: I found these first at my local supermarket.  I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it.  I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice "coffee" presence you can actually taste.  *Coffee* taste, not burned grounds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you're *not* into the "make your hair stand on end" type of coffee. This review is based on using the "medium" size on the coffee machine.  You may get different results if you use the small or large dispenser sizes.

The flavor of some dark roasts leave me with the impression I could get the same effect by just licking the bottom of a dirty ashtray.  (Sorry, dark-roast lovers - I tend to be overly sensitive to bitterness.)

review/text: You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to accomplish this. However sometimes I feel like something a tad bit lighter for that first cup in the morning. Enter Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. It's exactly what that first cup calls fall. A slightly lighter version of Nantucket Blend, yet it still has the subtle punch you're looking for.

review/text: My wife and oldest son don't like a strong coffee, so the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend works great for them. While I myself prefer the Coffee People's Organic, which is darker and more robust - similar to some of the blends found at Starbucks (not their regular blend). The Organic is strong enough for them to re-use once, after I've had the first brew.<br /><br />I also love that we can get the double pack of the Breakfast Blend 24 K-Cups inexpensively from Amazon. We purchase the Coffee People Organic in the 50-K-cup boxes.

review/text: The price of this has been fluctuating forever on amazon. This listing is the same one that different sellers will use. Some are better than others but the reviews stay with the product regardless of who is selling it at the moment. Until it becomes available as a frustration free 50 count box from amazon this is what we will have to deal with. There is another seller that offers free shipping on the 108 count box every once and a while and its free shipping for everyone not only amazon prime members. when you see it available do not hesitate on getting it. It goes fast because of the free shipping. It is still a little high at about 57 cents per cup but 43 is the lowest I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is our favorite everyday coffee. It is what we call "normal" coffee. It's not mild or bold or flavored its just a great medium body cup of joe.<br /><br />When you register your brewer with Keurig. You will be offered some free coffee. I would suggest you get this as your free coffee. You will also be offered free shipping with that order. So buy a lot of the 5 pack samplers and get the most out of the free shipping.

I tried brewing a small size, using a different size cup, adjusting my cream and sugar, nothing works! It's really disappointing because I've had other good blends from Green Mountain in the past. I'll stick with Wolfgang Puck's Rodeo Drive or Breakfast In Bed.

review/summary: Good flavor - a little too weak for me
review/text: Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts - however, the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial') - and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right-but-one button on the B70) - this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.<br />My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend' - which does seem to have got it right!

review/summary: Thin and lacking flavor
review/text: I got the Keurig as a present recently and have been trying all the samples that came with the unit. I like a smooth tasting coffee with lots of flavor, especially for breakfast. Unfortunately, the Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend left me flat.<br />All of the Keurig K-Cups lack the wonderful aroma that makes coffee drinking so enjoyable, but this breakfast blend is even less aromatic than others.<br />Flavors are, of course, a personal preference, and I can see the appeal of this coffee for some. It doesn't bite you, like many coffees, so if you're looking for a mellow flavor in the morning, this may be for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this one.

review/summary: Poor Labeling makes for a rip-off!
review/text: I have used this before, and like the coffee. But was not aware of the different strengths. Saw a statement about them as I reviewed today (in "product features" it says, "Please note: 'regular', 'bold' and 'extra bold' refer to the amount of coffee in the K-Cup"). There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.<br /><br />So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).<br /><br />Very, very disappointed!<br /><br />PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was "Light Roast". The other choice was "Regular". Leads one to wonder if they are clearing off old, outdated product.

You just need a kettle or a microwave.  And what a waste of space in your kitchen and landfill.  The worst part is that you don't know it's instant until you taste it, look carefully at the package, and see that it's "water soluble"-- code words for instant.  Open one up, and you'll see!

I could not detect any aftertaste as you get with medium or dark coffee blends.

The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.<br /><br />The taste is good--it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30ZU">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold) K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a><br /><br />It's not too heavy of a coffee, but none of the cups I have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from. Bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue.<br /><br />If you double-check the prices and get a good batch, it's a better than average cup of coffee.

review/text: I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K-Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K-Cup to get a decent, not overly-strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.  I do tend to go through them more quickly because of that, but that's okay. The great coffee is worth it!

I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods.

review/summary: Good Blend, but roast was too light.
review/text: I like the taste, but the light roast was too light for me.  I find myself brewing smaller cups of coffee, hoping for a stronger taste.  Next time, I'll go for a medium or dark roast.  I think it was the medium that I had before and I really liked it.

review/summary: Great mild breakfast coffee!
review/text: My wife has drunk this coffee for several years.  She tried many different brands before settling on this k-cup. It is a mild great tasting brew that you will like if you like a typical donut shop coffee. Not a Starbucks brew, but a regular mild brew. Give it a try.

review/summary: Love Green Mountain Breakfast Blend -- Great Coffee!!!!!
review/text: I just recently got my Keurig, and I've been trying the sample pack of coffee that came with it.  So far this is by far my favorite.  I nice mild coffee taste to enjoy in the morning or anytime.  I actually wish they made this coffee in a decaf version also so I could enjoy the great flavor of this one anytime!  I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.  (I've found that cream and sugar can't cover up the taste of coffee I don't like!)  I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning -- you won't be disappointed!!!

review/summary: Something's wrong with this coffee
review/text: These K-cups are either extremely old or they're not authentic Green Mountain K-cups. The coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste. Both my spouse and I have noticed this independently of each other.<br /><br />I tried to contact the seller to ask about this but couldn't figure out who it was.

review/summary: Terrible Price
review/text: I love this coffee and when I bought it, I also bought another brand. The price, around $20.00 was for two boxes of the other brand. I thought it was a pretty good deal although you can sometimes find it for $9.95 each at Target.  When they arrived, I discovered that I had paid for only one box of Breakfast Blend - a complete rip-off.  Even directly from Keurig, it's cheaper.  Will never buy this again.

review/summary: Do NOT buy from Mike's Grocers!!!
review/text: What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin

review/text: I was excited to see this 50 pack of coffee! Read all about how "if you like Dunkin Donuts, you'll love this".  Well its not good at all.  Comes out looking like tea. Has the flavor of coffee but its really just water.  Trust me, I am not a fan of the "Rocket Fuel" they serve at Starbucks but this is nothing like Dunkin.  Just cancelled subscription.

review/text: A great way to save money on buying K-Cups - in supermarkets these go for about 8-9 bucks for 12 cups.  You save so much money buying them in bulk like this, if you use them regularly.  I just picked up the 96 count after buying the 48 count 3 months in a row.

review/text: This Breakfast Blend from Green Moutain coffee company is my favorite flavor of coffee when I just want a regular cup of coffee without that extra kick from a bold blend or a flavored coffee.  It has always been consistent and calming in its flavor.  It is top-notch coffee.
