review/summary: Best Banana Chips!
review/text: I haven't had banana chips in quite some time, but then I never seriously liked them to begin with. They never had enough flavor. But...  since I've recently got on a health kick and want to lose some weight, I figured this sort of snack would be far better than chips or candy. Well...  color me a changed person on banana chips - these chips have a GREAT flavor and I've found myself having to limit how much I eat. Even my wife - who also never liked banana chips because of the lack of flavor and oftentimes complained of a nasty aftertaste - likes these Yankee Traders banana chips. We'll definitely be reordering these again - and again!

review/summary: One of the Best!
review/text: I won't say this is the best coffee in the world; because I have yet to try them all and everyone's tastes differ.  However, from my 20+ years of coffee drinking and of all the Kona coffee's I've tasted, THIS one reigns supreme.  And it better for that price!  But if you appreciate a well rounded, flavorful coffee, then this is the one to try.<br /><br />I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and was introduced to Kona coffee at the source.  Of all the coffees I've had in my life, Kona is my favorite.  It is the richest and smoothest you could imagine.  Others are good, but not in this class.  Also, watch out for Kona coffee blends.  They can be tasty, but are usually only 10% Kona beans and not the top crops at that.  This is the primo stuff here!  There really is something in that Volcanic soil on the Big Island.<br /><br />A word of caution though.  Drink this at your own risk.  It is very hard to go back to "normal" coffee after tasting this nectar of the gods.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Look no further
review/text: I am a medical school student and you might imagine how much coffee goes through my system in any given year.  I had Aloha Island first when I was an undergraduate and have since given up all other coffee.  Kona is by far the best there is out there, and Aloha Island is amazing.  I have tried 100% Kona from other retailers since my first dalliance with Kona, but not even the best of the premium coffees compare to the rich taste of Aloha Island's gold collection (which is their lowest grade).  The rich, dark grounds are perfect every time and make the perfect study break.  Now they say that the diamond collection is a special treat, but once you have a really good coffee it is so hard to go back to something that is below it.  I highly reccommend the diamond collection.  Word to the wise: don't stock up on this coffee; while it does last quite some time even with the most careless keeping, the coffee is best when kept in an airtight container and ground fresh for every cup.  The longer you keep coffee around, the more flavor it loses.

review/summary: This is the best coffee I've experienced on planet earth. period.
review/text: I am not a raving optimist and am a highly ciritical comsumer. I have never before publicly rated any product 5 stars. This is a 5-star product.<br /><br />Why? It tastes good :)<br /><br />Seriously, it has near-zero acidity, an inviting aroma, and can be drunk without prior consideration as a "dessert coffee" just as easily as a "breakfast coffe". It's as versatile as a swiss-army-knife and as refined as the highest grade Damast linen.<br /><br />I have had 7 other distinct Kona coffees purchased on my behalf on the Kona island and brought home for me to try. All others Konas were compared to this one and found lacking (in some cases seriously lacking). No "Kona blend" will ever again be found acceptable once you drink this coffee.<br /><br />So, not only is it a 5-star coffee among general coffees (including the "Charbucks" of the world...yech!), but it is a 5-star coffee among other high-achiever coffees.

review/text: This is by far the best coffee I've ever tasted.  I drink coffee black so I'm a comparison shopper for gourmet beans.  While it is expensive, you can taste the difference.  It definitely has a woodsy flavor with no aftertaste.  It's pure.<br /><br />Although I wouldn't drink it every day - it's an awesome treat and highly recommended for those that can appreciate it.

review/summary: Not What I Expected...
review/text: I bought this Kona brand of beans based on reviews and think the responses are somewhat exaggerated. I would imagine that some of these reviews are employees or friends of Aloha Island Coffee?  After shipping I paid $27.45 for a bag of beans that are okay, but nowhere near phenomenal as the review rave. Milestone brand found in most supermarkets retails $10 a pound and easily rivals the flavor of this brand. I will accept the fact that my disapproval may be due to my specific low acidic taste requirements. I do not like strong coffee with a bitter overtone, albeit this medium roast is on the strong side.<br /><br />In favor of Aloha Island Coffee, they did not hesitate to refund my money, keeping true to their claim of 100% satisfaction guaranteed.

review/summary: An excellent Kona blend.
review/text: The Diamond II is great. Rich but very smooth, not bitter at all. This is one that people will try and comment on without knowing anything about the coffee beforehand. I ordered it as a present for my dad, who loves coffee, but as soon as he brewed a pot it disappeared because of the amazing aroma. Everyone would suddenly decide to have coffee once they could smell it. The only people who didn't seem to really enjoy it both drink coffee that I find revolting. My stepbrother, who regularly drinks coffee that's been heated all day, and his girlfriend, who loves instant coffee, thought it was too weak. My advice: if you really love good coffee, then keep the Kona for yourself.<br /><br />Caveats: other reviewers imply that this is 100% Kona. It is not. It is a blend, although a very good one. Also, it is a medium roast.

I like all of the Ella's products, however this is one of my daughter's favorites!  Like the other products mixed with baby rice (brown rice, mind you), it is thicker in its consistency and might need to be watered down with a bit of breastmilk or formula (or water) for younger babies. I definitely wouldn't start with this; I'd try one of the ones that's primarily apples, pears, mangoes, etc.

review/text: We love all of Ella's Kitchen products, and our baby seems to enjoy this one.  We do add a bit of water to thin it out, as the products containing brown rice tend to be a bit too thick for a baby under 6 or so months.  I also wanted to point out that in our last shipment of this particular flavor, I noticed a few oddities on the nutrition information.  After a bit of searching, I realized that this particular order was "Product of Canada."  Not sure if this is at all a big deal (I doubt it), but just wanted to inform the seller and potential buyers.  Just seemed odd!

review/summary: Interesting texture and super-yummy!
review/text: My 6-month-old daughter loves all the "Brekkie" blends and we love knowing she's getting to experience a slightly different texture and a very different flavor as well.  I also love feeding her something knowing that I would enjoy it too, it helps me feel like I'm offering her the best (although I will feed her things I personally think are gross, because I don't want to limit her palate at all).  The pouches are the most convenient way to feed her too.  It helps keep the mess to a minimum and when used in conjunction with the Boon dispensing spoons, it turns feeding into a one-handed endeavor!  I was so excited to be able to introduce some different stuff once we got past the basics to check for allergies and all the exciting flavor profiles offered by Ella's are exactly what I wanted as a foodie mom.  Taste preferences develop at a surprisingly young age, so it's important to introduce lots of different flavors as soon as you can and thanks to all the modern baby food blends, I can find such a wide variety!  '  I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for some baby food.

review/summary: Eat This Great Mustard Quick!
review/text: I received my shipment of six bottles of this mustard in early January.  It is, in my opinion, the best mustard for a hotdog.  It really does make the hotdog taste like it has mustard and chili on it.  The problem is that my local grocer quit carrying it, so I had to move to Amazon.com to get it.  Another problem is that when you buy food items online, you can't inspect the product.  My case of mustard is due to expire in December of this year!  Now, I really like mustard, but I am unsure if I will be able to eat 63 ounces of it before Christmas.  I'm not sure if the chili seasoning has anything to do with the short expiration date or if I just got an old box.  In closing, let me just say again that this is the best hotdog mustard (assuming you like chili).  Give it a try, and if you get an old box, like I did, sell some of the bottles to your friends.  I'm selling some of mine for $2 apiece.

review/summary: Good Mustard - note only hint of chili taste though
review/text: A classic, strong, yellow-type mustard with a hint of chili flavoring.  Note that it definitely tastes like mustard though.  That extra suggestion of chili flavor adds appealing complexity to this condiment.  It's adaptable, and you don't need a lot to get the effect.  It's great even with simple things, like cheese and crackers.  It offers a suprisingly balanced but still punchy mustard flavor with a little something extra.

review/summary: Bacon and Eggs? Where Are the Hashbrowns?
review/text: First, you will note that I have given Blue Buffalo's "Health Bars with Bacon, Egg and Cheese Treats for Dogs" a five star rating - but that really wasn't my idea - rather that is the rating given to them by the Three Muske-Terriers: a male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. To be honest, the Cesky and Her Highness will eat just about anything - but the Westie is a true gourmet. If a treat passes the "Asta test," you know its got to be tasty - and these treats get five barks from Asta. But they are not just tasty, they're also good for your furry buddy, in moderation of course....<br /><br />Blue Buffalo's treats do NOT include wheat, corn or soy, (many dogs, including Her Highness, are allergic to these grains). Instead the ingredients include oatmeal, ground barley, ground whole oats, rye and flaxseed, along with chicken meal, bacon, dried eggs, cheese and carrots. The ingredients are all natural - although they are NOT organic, (if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you try those made by Robbie Dawg or Wagatha).<br /><br />The treats are baked for a nice crunch. They are rectangular - about an inch by an inch and a half, and maybe a quarter of an inch thick. They break in half easily, if you want to reduce the portion size.<br /><br />As for price, Blue Buffalo treats are in the same price range as treats made by other high-end and premium dog food manufacturers. They are not cheap, but I think their quality is worth the cost - and your dog probably will think so too.

review/summary: A fantastic olive oil for the price.
review/text: I'm an American which means I don't know squat about good olive oils.  Well, that used to be true.  Now I know a little something about them that I'd like to share with you.  I was a typical person... I bought olive oil at my local grocery store but I didn't really know anything about it.  In time I learned about cold-pressed olive oil being preferred.  Next i learned a little more about the deeper concepts of olive oil.  I sampled various relatively expensive domestic brands, the kinds available at my local Harris Teeter.  But my experiences weren't very fruitful.  I simply wasn't moved.  Until I decided to give in to a wild hare and order a foreign bottle of olive oil.  And WOW!  What a difference!! Such a fruitful nose and a beautiful color.  I never knew it could be like this.  I simply didn't have a clue that this could exist.  But what I ordered was fairly expensive.  At least compared to what I could get locally.  THIS PARTICULAR olive oil was my second foree into non-domestic samples.  And not only is it better than the first REAL olive oil I tried, it's cheaper.  If you choose this olive oil you're going to pay about 30% more than what you can get locally.  With shipping costs and all.  (Minus sales tax, yay!)  But this olive oil is very high quality.  And although it costs a tad bit more that what you can buy locally, the lift in quality makes it worth it ten times over.<br /><br />I just ordered my second bottle and I see this as being something I do every 3 or 4 months.

review/summary: Candy good but consider the time of year before ordering
review/text: As the title says the candy tasted as you would expect Mounds to taste in bite size servings (or two bite servings) but I ordered in the warm/hot time of year for southern Arizona (which is 90% of the time) and the candy reflected that temp.. It wasn't shipped in an insulated container so each piece had assumed a shape different than the normal factory shape (I popped them in the frig as soon as I got them). They tasted as expected but if you want traditional looking candy that is sensitive to the heat, consider the time of year before ordering.

review/summary: Not the greatest but not horrible either
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, this isn't the best food. These particular flavors are MUCH better than most Friskies wet foods. The canned Firskies verities are just terrible. The first few ingredients in these pouches are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) water sufficient for processing, ocean whitefish, chicken, and wheat gluten. At least there is real ocean white fish and chicken in it. Wheat gluten is pretty nasty stuff but at least there aren't by-products in these like there are in all the canned frisks. By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and although some of that can be found in this food, I am still weary of the Friskies name due to the terribly low quality canned and dry products. If you are going to go with Friskies, these pouches are the way to go. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality "foods".

review/summary: My cat loves it!
review/text: My cat is not only a very picky eater, she also has a very sensitive digestive system - she'll vomit most brands of cat meat after only a few days of eating them.  I mostly feed her dry cat food, but sometimes she'll want something a bit "meatier" and will refuse the dry stuff and demand meat instead.  But trying to find suitable brand that my cat likes, and doesn't make her vomit, has been difficult.<br /><br />Since I started feeding my cat the Friskies seafood variety in pouches, my cat has become more and more insistent about wanting to be fed them!  She goes crazy when she seems me getting her Friskies pouches out of the cupboard, and shoves her head into her food bowl before I can even finish emptying the packet!<br /><br />I've been feeding these pouches to my cat for about a month now, and they have not upset her sensitive digestion.  She loves them, and I am happy to be able to feed her something she enjoys so much.  I like that this particular product has a selection of flavors to choose from-all of which my cat seems to love equally-which prevents my cat from getting bored of the same old thing day after day.<br /><br />Since I feed her dry food as well, I only offer one pouch of Friskies food a day.  Therefore, I think the costs of feeding my cat this product are very reasonable.<br /><br />My only complaint about the product is that pouches are not the most convenient when it comes to feeding.  I like that there's enough for one meal for my cat inside each pouch (so there's no leftovers) but I have found that care is needed when opening the pouches - only this morning I tore open the pack and had gravy juice spill out onto my hand.  A little yucky, but not a major deal.<br /><br />Another problem I found with the pouches is that it's difficult to get every last chunk of meat out of them.  The meaty chunks do stick to the side and bottom of the pack, so either you throw away some or have to scrape it out with a fork.  The pouches aren't very easy for me to scrape out with a fork and doing so tends to cause a bit of a mess.  My cat gets so impatient with me whilst I am trying to empty the entire packet into her food bowl--she makes it really difficult by pushing her head in the way and meowing loudly.<br /><br />All in all though, my cat loves these and I love that my cat is so happy to eat them.

review/summary: Less flavor impact than liquid
review/text: I had previously used faerie's finest liquid raspberry flavoring with good results.  As many of my recipes require a low amt of liquid, I opted to change to a powder.  The powder is much less flavorful than the liquid.  The smell is not obvious (expected for powder).  However, this same effect carries over into the product.  The powder and liquid measurements are supposed to be equivalent.  However, putting in 1/2 tsp of powder resulted in minimal scent and taste.  I ended up using twice as much powder as liquid to get an equivalent effect.  The powder is a much weaker flavoring product than the liquid.  The taste is OK but does taste a bit more chemically than the liquid.

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: Here's some info that was important to me. The first few ingredients are; chicken meal, chicken, brewers rice, chicken fat, egg product, cracked pearled barley,... Crude protein 32%, crude fat 25%. 4710kcal/kg (2143kcal/pound)(470 kcal/cup)ME. Feeding Guide on the bag suggests about 4 cups/100 pound weight of an adult dog. I paid some cents over $1.00 a pound.<br /><br />We have 6 dogs, combined weighing 550 pounds. We live in a rural area where the dogs can run a lot. One of our dogs is under weight by 20+ pounds. After lab work the vet's determination was a high metabolism.<br /><br />The Thin One doesn't have the time to stand around a food bowl for the 10 to 12 cups other dog foods were suggesting. She can deal with 5 to 6 cups of the Diamond Extreme Athlete. I've been researching and trying foods for over a year.  I've feed elk, deer, bison, cow, goat, chicken, no grain, with grain, the list goes on. While the debate over "quality" ingredients rages on, nothing works if it's left in the bowl.<br /><br />I'll buy it again. A 40 pound bag lasts me like 100 pounds of some other brands. The price is very good, and it was delivered UPS. The most important thing is that all 6 dogs like it.

review/summary: Food for Life!
review/text: Very satisfied with the service. Our dog loves this food! There was even a slight discount for purchasing more than one bag. Unfortunately, in my haste to "click to buy," I neglected to notice the size of the bags. So you can imagine my surprise when the UPS truck delivered eighty pounds of dog food to the house. Now our neighbors think we might have bought a pony. . . Oh, well, our poodle puppy now has food for life! P.S. - This food was actually recommended by our breeder.

review/summary: Working dogs
review/text: I have a farm and one of my dogs is a service dog doing mobility work for me.  Our farm is literally on a mountain. It's really hard to keep weight on the working dogs, much less my youngster who ALSO goes everywhere with me with a backpack constantly balancing my weight! We have used this food for a couple of years now. I understand it is used by some mushers (sled dog trainers). Given the choice I honestly would use some of the higher quality diets. Every few months we get a batch that seems to make a few of my more sensitive dogs slightly under the weather. Diamond (rolling eyes). Overall, however, this is a far,  far better food than most grocery store brands, ANYTHING I have ever seen at Walmarts, and better bang for your buck on calories per dollar (do the math sometime, it's very revealing with regard to some of the "cheap foods").

review/summary: Awesome Food...Well worth the money
review/text: I have been using this food for the last year and it has just worked miracles on my two German Shepherds.  Lots of energy (sometimes to much, lol), great looking coats and my dogs love it.  My female will eat anything you put in front of her but my male is extremely picky.  They both eat this food like its desert.  I have recommended this food to several other friends and Shepherd breeders in the area and they have all had positive experiences.  A friend has a 4 year old Shepherd who is allergic to items such as corn and grains, he has been using this food for less than 2 months and his dog has completely stopped itching, has not had a hot spot and has less odor.  His coat has also started to really turn around from the dry blotchy coat he had before.  This food is basically Taste of the Wild with Diamond's packaging and name put on the bag but cost about $15.00 less and you get 10 extra pounds.  I would tell anyone if they are looking for a grain free, highend food, then as far as cost, quality and product is concerned, this is the best food on the market.

review/summary: You can smell the difference to run of the mill!
review/text: My puppies(Pitbull terrier-2.5 years/40 lbs & Pitboxer-8 months/40 pounds and growing)absolutely love this stuff. With pedigree sometimes it would sit in the bowl, until they got hungry enough to eat. With this stuff they come running & scarf it down. The older one has a very high metabolism. With the old stuff her weight would fluctuate; it was a challenge to get her to keep weight on. I'm sure its a combination of the high calorie content/the fact that she eats all of her food regularly that has helped her to now maintain a good weight. I know this food costs more than the run of the mill brands but there's no way I can make my girls go back to that other garbage. It even smells fantastic(for dog food), like it probably is full of flavor.<br /><br />*Addendum* We've been feeding this to our dogs for about 3 months now and they still love it! But even better, their coats have improved so much. The older one has allergies to dirt and it appears also perhaps to certain grains used as fillers in many low end dog foods. Since we've switched her food her balding spots are filling back in. The younger one has much coarser fur than the older one, but her fur has gotten softer/smoother to the touch, too. And as far as the cost goes compared to the lower end brands, with Diamond we go through a 40 lb bag in just about a month to the date versus 2 bags in a month with the lesser stuff which equals out to about the same price give or take a few dollars.

review/summary: Yes, great ingredients. But some Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br />I loved this company's Grain Free dog food.<br />I loved that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loved the food, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free.<br />Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her horrible allergies and out of control tear stains.<br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/text: Sizzle sticks were said to be odor free, and they are, so I'm rating them 5 stars. I can't attest to how much my dog liked them because he expressed no interest in them, but I wouldn't fault the sticks for this. He's elderly, a very finicky eater and not a chewer. I thought i'd give these a try, but will leave it to others to report on them. (I think most experienced dog owners know that what appeals to some dogs, doesn't appeal to others, so I would never fault a product on that basis).

Worth the extra $ and is a treat.  We make iced tea by the gallon at home and seems smoother and maybe a little sweeter than the other brands we normally use.  Wish the bags weren't individually wrapped.  Use 8 for a gallon.  Will save a box for hot tea with winter comming.

review/summary: Consistent and very high quality
review/text: Illy espresso beans are my favorite of all the widely available commercially produced roasted espresso beans. This is the standard medium roast that Illy produces and it is a bit less aggressive and milder tasting than the dark roasts of Lavazza (the other major Italian brand that some people favor).<br /><br />When properly ground, tamped, and brewed Illy espresso has a delightful aroma and flavor, unmatched by any of the other brands.<br /><br />Granted, Illy is quite pricey, and I do not use it all the time for this reason. However, you get what you pay for. Usually, I buy my espresso from a small roasting house in the Midwest that produces a decent medium roast substitute that I do not mind using most of the time. But Illy definitely produces a higher quality bean.<br /><br />One way to judge the quality of roasted espresso beans even before you taste the coffee that they will produce is to look at the evenness of color and size of the beans. The reason is that beans of a uniform size tend to roast more evenly than beans of varying sizes. Moreover, even when the beans are of a uniform size, it is important that they be roasted in small batches and churned during the the entire roasting process to ensure that they all get roasted to the same point. This is why most high quality coffee is roasted in small batches in a rotating drum that roasts all the beans to the exact same point. Moreover, since the moisture content of the beans varies a bit from batch to batch, quality control in the roasting process is extremely important. And it is here that Illy is unmatched. Just do a simple visual comparison of the color and consisteny of Illy beans when compared to any of the other widely available brands and you can easily see why Illy is the best.

review/summary: Terrific Arabica beans for full flavor Espresso/Cappucino
review/text: Francesco Illy started the business in 1933 in Triest/Italy<br />He wanted perfection. Arabica coffee beans of the highest order, treated with the utmost respect, delivering the finest taste.<br />Today, with the third Illy generation leading the family business nothing has changed.<br />Arabica beans have less than 1,5% caffeine. Since they grow mainly in the mountain climate they are sensitive and more difficult to grow/harvest but they are the only ones that can guarantee outstanding flavor and taste.<br />That is what you get when you open the can. And once again after grinding them: a moment of aaah when you inhale the wonderful scent of the freshly ground coffee beans.<br />Please forget about the price and don't compare this with any of the mixed blends. They give me headaches. 100% Arabica are the only beans I drink and love. You want flavor, get Illy. It's one of the best.<br />Enjoy! (f.e. together with Neuhaus chocolate or Sapori Amaretti)

review/summary: Simply the best Italian espresso
review/text: Superb balance. Great lingering sweetness, not at all harsh, moderate brightness. Essentially everything that I search for in an espresso. The bean aroma is very sweet with hints of hazelnut shells. The roast is lighter than most of the Lavazza blends (although it was darker that the Tierra I tried) and much lighter than the beans you would find used in a popular America coffee franchise. In my opinion, this is what really lets this coffee shine, complementing the deep caramels with its restrained brightness and giving way to fruity notes.<br /><br />One very important note: do not simply seal this coffee in the can with the lid after you use it. The can is not airtight, and my first can was stale overnight. I thought that my barista skills were steadily declining, but when I opened the second can the difference in flavor and aroma were astounding. Place it immediately into an airtight container and use within a week. Too bad that this coffee is so expensive, or I would be pulling shots with it all the time. If you've never tried it, splurge a little. It will be memorable.

Cut it in half long-ways and smear butter and/or olive oil all over the bread. Sprinkle on the seasoning and broil for a few minutes (or if you're cooking out, put it on the grill!) It even makes cheap white bread taste great! If you want even more pizzaz, add chunks of roasted garlic and/or parmesan or mozarella cheese. So glad to find a great price on amazon. It's nearly double this price at my local grocery store.

I had to start over and use vanilla at the last minute. Thankfully the bride was very understanding. I DO NOT recommend this product. (Also, when I contacted the seller to try to send it back, they would never reply. Obviously they don't stand behind what they sell. Money Wasted.)

review/text: We've purchased these for a long time, and the salt & pepper flavoring makes them even more addictive than even normal salted pistachios are...however...<br /><br />Quality of this product has slipped:  they used to "guarantee" that you wouldn't get an unopened nut in the bag...now, they are no better than other bags of pistachio nuts in terms of un-split nuts that you basically have to toss.  Also, the size of the nuts has gotten smaller in my perception.  They used to be noticeably bigger and fatter than any others I was familiar with.  Now, I would say they're just "average." Lastly, I'm not so sure purchasing them thru Amazon that we're getting the freshest bags available...I often sense that even a newly-opened bag is not at the top of its game, so to speak.  Althoug the seasoning does still make them special (betcha can't eat just one...), the company should renew its commitment to product quality and step up their game.

review/text: I bought this item since it has good reviews but it was not delivered as what other people described. The package was shipped by a USPS prioity envelop, not in a box.  When it was arrived, it was partically torn; many chocolate coins got deformed already, and some were melted even though the seller put a cool pack inside. I didn't want to pass these defected ones out for our baby shower, so we ended up with preparing something instead.  Besides, they tasted waxy.  We were glad we ended up with not giving out these to our guets.

review/summary: happy with the purchase
review/text: We bought these for our baby shower to put in an organza pockets from a dollar store as party favours, which also included Darice 7 Ounce It's a Boy Buttermints<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />and Rubber Duck Ducky Duckies<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Such gifts were a great hit among our guests--they all loved them.<br /><br />Besides the fact that they were delivered in a big box (packed with lots of foam and a cool pack), they taste good.<br /><br />We are taking them to a hospital to hand out to the staff before we head home with our new born.

review/summary: Excellent Product but Watch Out Price Keeps Increasing
review/text: We absolutely LOVE all the Plum Organics Pouches.  They are awesome for lunch boxes.  I am a parent of 3 1/2 yr. old twins. One cannot process fresh fruits and veggies but with these products I don't have to worry.  He will now eat five different varieties.  The only complaint I have is that they keep saying the item is no longer available for subscribe and save then one day later it becomes available at a higher price.

review/summary: My fave of the Campbell "light" soups
review/text: This is a very nice soup for those watching calories and wanting a scosh less salt than is usual for Campbell's soups. It's a tomato-based soup with a light dose of rice, black beans, and chicken. It's not thick or chunky. I'd call it a medium-density soup. Enough broth to slurp for those who like a not-stewish soup. Not super hot or spicy, but flavorful all the same.<br /><br />I find that it's very nice on its own, but I prefer it with more black beans (I just add canned ones) and chopped tomato and a sprinkle of low-fat cheddar cheese. That really makes it into a nice light meal, satisfying and flavorful.<br /><br />But I think if you like tomato-based soups and a Mexican vibe, this will agree with your taste buds. I consider it a pantry staple for lunch now.<br /><br />I do find the regular cans of this tastes slightly better. Maybe heating it in the can transfers some of the metal taste. Not sure. But if you can find the regular cans, I'd go that route.<br /><br />One cup has 130 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 8 grams of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, 2.5 grams of fat ( 1 gram of those is of saturated fat.) It also has 480mg of sodium, and 800 of potassium. I add the low-fat (or fat free) cheese for both flavor and to up the protein to balance the carbs.<br /><br />I hope Campbell's keeps making these. Nice quickie soup.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: Amazingly Good
review/text: For an off the shelf microwaveable product, this tortilla soup is amazing. We love tortilla soup and often eat it both in the U.S. and Mexico. Campbell's version holds it own among the best we have had. It would be even more perfect if Campbells could use tortilla strips instead of rice. Also nice...Amazon's price is much lower than our local supermarkets.

review/summary: Love this soup
review/text: This is a quick, easy, healthy lunch. I've eaten this flavor of soup for years and do not tire of it. It is great with corn chips mixed in, or cheez its! Shredded cheese, jalapeno slices... whatever you like.<br /><br />The price is great on Amazon too, and with free shipping, I'm so happy to have found it here. I'd have to travel about 15 miles to Super Walmart to get it for a comparable price. (over $3/bowl at the closer grocery stores!) So this saves money and gas. Love it.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: Both my wife and I eat this soup. It's not anything close to real chicken tortilla soup, but it's a great substitute. To answer one of the other reviews, yes the microwaveable version is a little less than filling. So I suggest the can, which has more chicken, rice, beans, and corn. The broth on its own is tasty. I don't realiize the salty taste as some, but I like flavor added to my soup. The chicken is much better in this than other brands, it's not any weird color or tiny. There is large white chicken meat in the soup. I usually break mine up a little just to have a more chicken ratio to soup.  The can by the way is done in just about the same amount of time on the stove top as the microwaveable version.<br />Suggestion, sprinkle a colby jack or "fiesta" blend of cheese after it comes off the stove and toss on some of those tortilla strips in the salad aisle, and you have yourself an amazing bowl of soup!<br />By the way, I've never seen carrots in this soup, not sure what soup the other reviewer was eating. No true Hispanic puts carrots in their tortilla soup, ew.
