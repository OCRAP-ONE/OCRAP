review/text: I have enjoyed Zatarain's products and, therefore ordered a number of boxes of dirty rice and cheese via Amazon's Subscribe and Save process.  My problem is the items received expire in like 108 days (12 boxes).  I have purchased items at local stores and the best by date are almost always at least year in advance.  This shipment appears to be at the very tail end of the cycle - the items are clumpy and appear to have been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time (obviously). Ok gotta run and eat some before the expiration date!

review/summary: Iced coffe fan.
review/text: I'm a huge fan of the Keurig but in the Summer I need my iced coffee and previously I've been using 2 k-cups, or a making a very small cup of iced coffee because I didn't want it to be watered down.  I like my coffee reasonably robust although not quite as strong as some popular coffee shops make it, and I like a big cup, 20 oz. So the small cup wasn't working out for me and using 2 k-cups meant I was plowing through my box in no time at all.  Today I discovered the Green Mountain French Vanilla Iced Coffee. I filled my 20 oz plastic cup with ice just like it said and set my Keurig to the cup size closest to 8 oz. YUMMY!!!!!!  It's exactly what I had hoped it would be. Usually even a small amount of half and half and the ice would make my coffee too light and watered down, but it didn't.  It was great, I'm hooked already and I've only had one cup.  Also in case you are wondering.  There are 2 less k-cups in the box, BUT each cup weighs  more, .60 ounces verses .45 ounces. They simply put more coffee in the iced k-cups and the result makes me really happy. Just had my last sip which has been sitting on ice while I write my review, still yummy!!!  Hope this review helps.

review/text: When I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, I realized I needed to change some of my eating habits. I realized a glass of orange juice in the morning was too high in sugar and too low in fiber, so I looked for a decent tasting alternative. Crystal Light Sunrise Classic is the perfect substitute for my morning OJ. It tastes great, has no carbohydrates, and even has Vitamin C and Calcium in it. It's the perfect breakfast drink for people watching their weight or their carbohydrate intake. I LOVE IT!

review/text: I've been drinking various flavors of Crystal Light for years, and before I was diagnosed as diabetic, I drank Tang fairly often. Crystal Light Classic Orange pretty much is sugar-free Tang.<br /><br />When I asked my grocery store (Tops) to stock this item, they apparently thought that a 20-year customer should not have the temerity to make such an outlandish request (sarcasm intended) and completely disregarded it.<br /><br />The service from VSD has been excellent. They ship generally within 24 hours of order placement, and the product arrives in good shape. I would order from them again.

review/text: We moved to Natural Choice Grain Free dog food about 6 months ago. Since making the move, our dogs' don't act hungry all the time, which is huge for them. Now mind you, being Labs, they'll eat anytime, given the opportunity - but they don't act like hyenas anymore. :)  Within a week, we saw reduced stool, and the stool looks more like a wild animals' (if you've ever seen coyote stool or something like that) - it dries out almost immediately and is very easy to clean up. One of my labs always had loose stool, ever since we got him as a pup - this is the only dog food that ever fixed that. Is this worth the extra cost? YES!

review/text: Brewing a cup of tea first thing in the morning wakes me up. For once, the mounded teaspoon per cup is perfect! Flavor- distinct without being overbearing. Color- perfectly balanced, just the way a green tea should look. Spice- just right, not too little, not too much. Bitterness factor- minimal. I usually prefer to brew one cup at a time to reduce the likelihood of tea turning into something that tastes like paint thinner. A whole teapot full maintains flavor without turning those steeping tannins into overwhelming brown goo. My daughter even prefers it to her usual Stash Green Chai. I love the fact it stays fresh in my tin. The cost of bulk is substantially lower to bagged but only worth it if the flavor is satisfying. With this tea, it is!!!

review/summary: Enjoyable, but a Challenge
review/text: Let me start this review with this bit of information: I have yet to home in on the proper way to prepare this tea. I'm working on quantity, temperature, and steeping time. So far I've tried the usual 1 tsp for every 8 oz of water but that appears to be too little. Now I try about a tablespoon and a half for a 24 oz. pot and steep it for about five minutes. If you steep it too long it gets rather bitter, though this is mostly remedied with the addition of milk, but I worry that the tea is still not being prepared ideally. If I get better results with my next test, 1 tablespoon per 12 oz. of tea, steeped for about 5 minutes, I will change the review to 5 stars. I'm hoping to get more of the flavor and less of the strong bitterness, but even as it is, it's still a bargain for the price.

review/summary: Tea Review and Kombucha Recipe: Davidson's Green Chai w/Orange Peel
review/text: For the past three months, I've been purchasing a lot of bulk green teas online to steep and brew in various formats.  In recent weeks. I've been particularly engaged with making Kombucha --  fermented tea using a visible, solid mass of yeast and bacteria which creates a healthy, carbonated tea beverage.  To help others who share this interest, and endeavor, I'll be posting a series of tea reviews and related kombucha recipes. This is the first.<br /><br />The green tea blend, containing cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, orange peel and other flavors is as fragrant and tasty as it sounds in nearly every format.  The blend is darker in color and heavier in flavor than most green teas. I only wish I had discovered in 7 or 8 months ago -- at the beginning of winter.<br />In brewed form, it's reminiscent of mulling spices, making it ideal for cold wintry nights.  As an iced tea, it remains strong and flavorful, but lacks the light character I prefer for iced teas.  The perfect way to use this tea, in my opinion, is to make Kombucha.  The fermentation process really compliments the spices and the added carbonation that results from the process lightens the flavor and highlights its citrus undertones.<br /><br />This blend is destined to remain one of my favorites.  It's tasty. It's flexible. It's inexpensive.<br /><br />If you're interested in using this tea to brew kombucha, you can find my recipe for doing so here:<br />[...]

review/text: I really wanted this to be good, because I like the idea of using loose tea instead of tea bags, but it wasn't. Everyone who complains about the maple syrup taste hits it right on the head. Looking over the ingredients, I don't see what could possibly impart such a strong aroma and flavor, but it is definitely there. I almost suspect that something that doesn't belong fell in the mixing bin, and they are just sending it out anyway. I don't normally drink my Chai tea the traditional way, with milk, so I thought I'd give that a try to see if it improved the flavor any, and what I got tasted exactly like the milk you get when you make a bowl of oatmeal and put brown sugar in it. Same exact flavor. If thats what your going for, than this is your product. I'll stick to Stash Kashmiri Chai green tea.

review/summary: great smell, alittle bitter perhaps?
review/text: I was browsing around for some new loose leaf tea to try out and when i saw this it sparked my interest and sounded REALLY good. When it arrived i was so excited i could smell the spices and orange even before i opened the box. I was really looking forward to the taste, I like orange and chai and i loved all the spices listed. However when i made the tea and gave it a try it seemed VERY bitter to me, I didnt really taste the spices which made me sad because i had been looking forward to it, instead it just had this bitterness and that was all that came through, no orange or spice. I added a couple spoons of sugar and alittle milk though, and that mellowed out the bitter and helped bring out the spices somewhat. So it wasnt a complete loss. I think it will continue to grow on me however, i just wished it tasted as great as it had smelled! it isnt bad though just not the best i have ever had. I will try to make another cup or two of it and maybe that will help also. Right now I am somewhere between it is ok and i like it. I would not say i loved it or that it was terrible. it's just different. The pricing was great I feel. I think I will try some other teas by davidson's. I do enjoy it with alittle milk and 2 spoons of sugar, maybe a little honey instead of sugar would be good as well? a nice tea but not as great as i first thought it would be.

review/summary: Nuts to those other brands
review/text: I've been a Planters eater for years and when the price wasn't right I'd try the store brand. However, I was tired of eating nuts that were on the soft side, had lots of pieces and were getting pricier by the month. Time to look for an alternative and since I have eaten other Emerald nuts I thought I'd give these a try. In a word, they're outstanding. The peanuts are pretty much hole, very dry, not too salty, taste great and are very crisp. I mention the crisp because, to me, that indicates fresh and the softer Planters I was getting seemed stale in comparison even though the sell-by date was current.<br /><br />Granted, taste is relative but freshness is pretty straight forward and so is price. I purchased these for about thirty four bucks so that's about 75 cents a jar less than the name brand I am complaining about. These are so good I'm now subscribed to save a little more on each shipment.

review/text: Emerald dry roasted peanuts lightly salted with sea salt are absolutely the best peanuts on the market today!  They contain peanuts and salt - without a long list of added unhealthy ingredients.  As a matter of fact, we need another case of these peanuts and cannot find them on Amazon now!  We are desperately looking to make another purchase at the same price.  We would appreciate this item being offered again!

review/summary: Stellar Blue Corn
review/text: This blue corn masa (flour) is exceptional. I bought it to use in a variety of ways: cornbread, stuffing, tortillas and recently, I made gorditas with it.  I'm gluten free so using corn as a grain is nice from time to time.  The blue corn variety is deeper and much richer in taste than it's yellow counterpart. I prefer the richness it has when combined with other food. However, if I was just making cornbread for example (which is all about the corn and nothing much combined in it) I'd probably go for the yellow flour which is less intense. Making corn tortillas from the blue corn and stuffing the tortillas with ground beef, salsa, etc...is a much better experience with the blue corn; it adds an intensity to the whole taste. I love it. I'd like to try making tamales using the blue corn masa. I'll report back.

review/summary: From Peru via Lynwood, Washington...re-lablelled
review/text: Flour is a Peruvian varietal packaged in Washington State, near Lynwood, near where I lived last year.  It is "from Lynwood, WA, USA."  In my suburban Jewish Mother opinion, this product "should" not be $30 a small box, but it is properly milled (fine grind) and probably on a small mill by a lot of people devoted to quality, that part shows, *** for quality.  It's not USDA Organic minus *.  Minus another * for price, and if it's kosher/vegan add 1/2 *.  (not kosher certified on box.)<br /><br />I did find medium grind USDA Organic corn meal only in the local organic chain store (New Seasons is the only local grocery-type store that has both 100% organic produce and packaged foods, some "traditional" ones and for about 20% more than "traditional" groceries, but a consistent stock, responsive management, friendly clerks...and most importantly lots of stores they are all the same inside.) "Medium" grind will NOT make a good tortilla, it will crumble, you need fine grind or a grinder.  The product being reviewed IS the fine grind.<br /><br />So why did i buy it? it's the right grind for tortillas with the tortilla maker i bought.<br /><br />The flavor is a bit different too, not corny if you compare with the GMO cheapo tortillas from the usual grocery store, but closer to the taste of a handmade organic tortilla you might find somewhere in a health food store like Eerewon (good luck with that, Erewon's mostly in Los Angeles) or maybe Whole Foods, did not check there.  If you're in Berkeley, CA try Berkeley Bowl.  If you're in Washington or Texas, try Central Market.  Trader Joe does not have organic corn tortillas as far as I know.  I found one shop in my travels, can't remember which shop, so that's why I am doing it myself.  It's more fun this way and they can be frozen.  The idea is to make little dough-balls (great with kids, grandkids, kindergarteners) and smash them.<br /><br />So mix up the and distilled water and let it sit in fridge, then make appropriate dough ball corresponding to whatever size tortilla you want. It has to be cold but not frozen, like playdough for grilled breads. Also you want it about as thick as an old LP vinyl record, not too thin but not too thick, make the thickness of one ceramic bath tile.  You'll know right away if it's too thin.  If it's not done in two minutes, it's too thick.  If you don't have a cast iron press, use a rolling pin or an empty wine bottle.<br /><br />experiment with different flours, but always heat and grease the machine first, otherwise dough will STICK.  Testing with a drop or two of oil or water works.  I use organic flax or olive with a pastry brush, you want a thin coat of oil, then press.  If you're making tortillas, get the pan greased and heated, but also coat the tortilla press so the tortilla will press off, I don't like plastic, a sandwich baggie is another method for those who can't have any oil.  If you're vegan use egg substitute for the pizzelle, post if that works.  If you're kosher, no problem, tortillas are paerve.<br /><br />The griddle or the pan has to be HOT and you have to watch it.  no turning of the back, watch it or you will have a black tortilla or a well done pizzelle.<br /><br />It's not a pancake, it cooks longer and texture is different.<br /><br />Pizzelle should take one minute tops if everything is set up, someday maybe I will make a youtube...don't hold your breath, you tube involves talking sound editing i don't know what else skills I am not great at.<br /><br />In any event, both keep in the freezer and can be thawed when ready to use by leaving on counter for a few hours or even in a pinch in a toaster, and make good, cheap nutritious snacks, as long as healthy fats used and no sugar overload is in the pizzelle or dairy high fat cheesy stuff poured on top of either bread, because they are both specialty breads and best with a bit of something but also good by themselves if fresh.<br /><br />since first posting i notice this http://www.amazon.com/Regular-finely-ground-perfect-recipes/dp/B0006N2PE0/ref=pd_sbs_gro_5 and others with lower prices, i don't know if it is same quality, fresher, etc. but if you want FRESH, buy whole dry corn cut off cob yourself and mill it with a Champion juicer MILL attachment.  If you want purple pastry, you can still find a better price and then compare quality.  Food should be fresh regardless of who sells it to you.  It should not be $30 with s/h.  It should be roughly what you pay at a specialty grocery store, and if your local store has overpriced stock, just print out the amazon ad and take it to the manager, they will usually honor fair market value if they have something overpriced it's often because they did not first check amazon.  Amazon does beat or meet most local grocery stores even on obscure gourmet items! I suppose it's worth it if you want something fast, live in WA, get it without paying shipping and are going to use it for coloring baked goods naturally...beet juice works well for that also.<br /><br />it might be instructive to get someone to photograph small samples of all these flours, so people don't have to buy a box and find out they don't have a recipe for it, or it's stale or not what they expect, and to have little descriptions of each sample, like we do with hops, wine, cheese...because all flours are not created equally!  the organic ones especially can be expensive...but not this expensive.  sometimes the cost of s/h is inflated because of s/h "policy" that might be something not just this seller can look at and scrutinize, most of my complaints (very few actually considering how much i buy and how consistently i buy) boil down to some shipping/handling problem, but s/h will only communicate with seller who hired them....it is generally only a problem with foodstuffs, a broken machine can be photographed, repackaged and often repaired locally, food cannot.  there should be separate written policy for pricing packing and shipping foodstuff, some vendors do a great job, others not so much.

review/text: Many folks are unaware that decaffeinating coffee makes is<br />more expensive. At about $1.15 a pouch I can make a double<br />decaf espresso-latte drink that would ordinarily cost me<br />$4.15  at my local corporate chain. This  company<br />makes a nice clean, GREEN ( organic) decaf.  I have<br />to switch to after 12 noon. I am a solid javaholic on-the-go. It  makes a huge difference when the whole process of coffee<br />making is made with good water, organic and kosher beans.<br /><br />Caffeine-sensitive people can be reacting to the chemicals use to process decaf. None of that with Java Juice.  As an organic food eater on a budget, this product can't be beat for highest quality at the best price. Don't forget to to cook with it Their  [...] website has recipes. I like mine blended with ice and soy milk.<br /><br />I bought an 80 pack counter box and brought it to the studio where I work.  It made me VERY popular that week. ( Next time I am organizing a pool, everyone adds 5 bucks and we'll have enough for a month)  If you enjoy rich aroma and flavor coffee but prefer Decaf, I suggest you try this product. Great shipping, delivery from Amazon as usual.

review/summary: Splurge for vegetarians & carnivores alike!  Eat morels, save a cow.
review/text: The first time I ever tried morel mushrooms was at the famous Chez Panisse in Berkeley, CA, owned by Alice Waters.  WOW...it was so amazingly good, and I'll remember that meal for the rest of my life.<br /><br />If you're currently a vegetarian, but enjoyed beef steaks in a past life, you may never crave beef again, once you've had morel mushrooms.  They're a bit pricey, but worthwhile for that occasional splurge.  If you're a hard-core meat eater, you're gonna think that you're eating beef.  Morels have a great mouth feel, where it's more steak-like in texture, and not watery, like oyster or button mushrooms.<br /><br />If you're thinking about preparing a special meal, include some morels the next time.  If you already love various types of fungi, this is gonna be the BEST you've ever had.

review/summary: Recipe, quality and size cheapened
review/text: New edit:  This is really annoying.  I posted this review for the "Natural Light" variety, and it was originally on that page.  Now that the "Natural Light" was discontinued, they moved my review to this version where it doesn't apply.  However it is still true that the company which purchased Orville Redenbacher, ConAgra, no longer is making a less salty, 3.5oz/bag popcorn with unrefined palm oil.  This is a shame as no one else is either.  Despite what amazon.com has been doing, this is not an acceptable substitute for the other product and shouldn't be sent without permission to people who had the "Natural Light" on subscription delivery.  And after over a year of complaints, the bag size in the description should have been corrected.  Amazon.com, this is really shoddy behavior, and leads me to think it is a matter of mega-companies sticking together to scam customers out of our hard-earned cash.<br /><br />This review has been edited to reflect the mfr.'s change of the product.<br /><br />When I first reviewed this popcorn, I was describing the popcorn as it was in 2006.  It was made w/ very healthy unrefined palm oil containing nutritious beta-carotene and no trans fats.  It was also 3.5oz per bag.<br /><br />The mfr. has degraded the product.  It's now made w/ partially hydrogenated soy oil that has trans fat, and they've shrunk the bag to 2.9oz..  It's not any healthier or tastier than econo-brands now, but it is still much more expensive.  You also have to cook it for less time than is printed on the bag b/c of the smaller amount or it will burn.<br /><br />Whenever a good product is cheapened like this I always do an online search to see if the company was acquired, and sure enough, ConAgra bought Orville Redenbacher.  If you scan the reviews you'll see that almost all the 5-star reviews were written before 2007.  So don't bother complaining to the company about the decline in quality, b/c they don't care.

We were so pleased when we found it at Amazon.com--got it at a good price--and had free shipping.  Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Delicious.
review/text: When I first tried this I thought it tasted bland, but on my second attempt I shook the bag prior to opening it, and it was much much better.  Now I eat it all the time.  Compared to the "Natural" flavor which is extremely salty, the Light Natural flavor has a great buttery taste (palm fruit oil) and just a hint of salt.  Perfect.<br /><br />Other customers recommend Bearitos No Salt No Oil brand, but for me that's like eating paper (or foam packing peanuts).  Redenbacher's Light Natural provides just enough flavor to make the popcorn palatable while still being very low in fat (2 grams versus 4.5 grams) and calories (110 versus 120).

review/summary: Great taste that even the kids love!
review/text: I like it because it's not greasy, and not so salty that my lips burn.  Just the right amount of salt to give it some flavor.  My kids and their friends even like this popcorn, and I feel better serving it to them.  If you normally get regular buttered popcorn, you'll notice a difference, but Orville's Light Natural might surprise you with its great taste.

review/summary: NOT 3.5 OZ. PER BAG!
review/text: Wrong info. under Product Features. It claims each bag contains 3.5 ounces. I received my box of 36 bags today, and every bag is only 2.9 ounces. So, instead of the 126 ounces claimed, they only send 104.4 ounces total. The difference is 7.44 ounces, or enough for another 2.57 bags of popcorn! It would also be nice if one could call up the Nutrition Facts of food products on Amazon - then I would have known O.R.'s Natural has 300mg of sodium per serving, compared to O.R.'s Light Butter at only 190mg of sodium/serving. Calling Natural "Simply Salted" implied to me less salt, and so I find it misleading. Posting Nutrition Facts would eliminate ambiguity and make things clear for customers.

review/summary: Extreme disappointment
review/text: In Sept of 2008 I ordered my customary case of this popcorn....after realizing that the name had been changed but the ingredients were the same.  At least half of that case of 3-packs were dry and burned when cooking.  These bags were tough and tasteless, not light and fluffy as I had come to expect.  I have not received satisfactory treatment from the manufacturer, but I'll be persistent and hope to get at least half of my money refunded as half of the popcorn went into the trash.

All microwave types that I<br />have tried leave a bit of a sensation of a<br />certain flavoring added to the corn,<br />thus diminishing a "pure", authentic corn taste.

review/summary: An Excellent Compromise
review/text: This popcorn is an excellent middle ground between popcorn with alot of butter & the<br />popcorn that is 94% [or more] reduced fat/butter & as a result is really way too dry! The taste has just enough flavor but not overly oily, etc. Sometimes we actually mix a light butter or movie theater butter flavor with this 50% less fat version & it results in all around very tasty popcorn. The health aspects of this popcorn has been commented on before in other reviews, however I will say, it seems that the overall fat content is in fact relatively low. As has been mentioned by other reviewers this popcorn is VERY hard to find generally in stores & I am wondering if Conagra is in the process of discontinuing this product?? In any case as long as Amazon carries it we will buy it!!

We use subscribe and save and are on our 3rd case because we enjoy a bag most evenings.

review/text: Taste is good but just not very "Light" at all IMHO.  I peeked inside the bags of this creature and there is a large amount--looks like 3 or 4 pats worth of orangy-looking "mystery" fat there.  You can remove some it and reseal the bag by folding over... which I recommend that you do with this, but it's a lot of trouble.  Why bother the Orville Redenbacher 94% microwave popcorn is the real article but Amazon does not have it yet as of 1-1-2009.  Look again later, their buyers will probably get it in soon.  I really, really like Orville 94% Fat-free popcorn and it is the one to beat.  Act II has about 50% more salt than the other brands for no apparent reason.  Popcorn is a very healty snack if not adulterated.

My recipes were for the toffee bit pieces only. We have<br />several grocery stores in my area that had carried it in years past, so I<br />had thought this product was no longer made. Much to my delight Amazon not only carried it but at a very reasonable price. One tip I might add is that since this product comes in boxes of 12, they do freeze perfectly. I just put the extras in a ziploc bag and pull a bag out of the freezer as I need it. This product can get a rancid or off taste otherwise if not used in a timely manner. But frozen they remain unchanged, and does not affect the quality in the slightest.

review/summary: These toffee bits rock!
review/text: Once upon a time one could purchase toffee bits in grocery stores. I've used brickle bits in muffin recipes, for pie crusts, over ice cream. Then, at one point, stores stopped carrying the toffee bits. You can get the Heath bar variety, but there are times when just plain old toffee bits are called for.<br /><br />Amazon to the rescue. After having searched every grocery store in the Seattle area, I looked online, and there they were. Toffee bits. Just waiting for me to order.<br /><br />I have more brickle bits than I know what to do with now, so I've given a few bags away. I gave one to a woman I work with a few days ago, just on a whim. 'Oh my GOD!' she cried out, 'I have been looking for this EVERYWHERE!.' She was making a pumpkin toffee cheesecake. It was nice to bring such great joy with such a small thing.<br /><br />I hope Amazon continues to carry these toffee bits. As soon as it looks like I may be running low I will put in another order.

review/text: The flavor wasn't too bad...a lot of outside reviews said that the flavor of bael fruit took some getting used to, but these packets were pre-sweetened and the flavor wasn't overpowering.  It was a bit difficult to dissolve in cold water, so I would put a little hot water at the bottom to dissolve the powder and then add cold water and ice if you would like it cold instead of hot.

review/summary: Taste horrible!
review/text: I got it for the health benefits, which I won't be able to experience because this taste and smells like sweet ass.  One of my coworkers enjoyed it so I'll be passing both boxes to him and will just continue to eat more fruits and vegetables.  If you don't mind the taste, Bael Fruit has amazing health benefits.  Unfortunately, the taste of sweet ass is not to my liking.

review/summary: Wonderful but unavailable
review/text: These fiber bars are the best I have ever had but they have become unavailable.  The seller had to cancel my order because they could not get any from the manufacturer.  I contacted the manufacturer and they are indeed out of stock.  I fear they will stop making this wonderful product!

review/summary: Great but!!!!
review/text: I purchased a box of apple bars recently thru Amazon.  Some were soft & some were very hard-the wrapper was not properly sealed.  Called Renew Life Customer Service & they replaced box happily but the replacement box was the same way.  Have tried apple & cranberry-both are very tasty when they are not too hard to eat.

review/summary: very good
review/text: I just bought this bar at my Local Health food store and I love the taste. It has a great lemon flavor no funny aftertaste and it has 14 grams of Fiber. My only gripe is that they are a bit pricey.
