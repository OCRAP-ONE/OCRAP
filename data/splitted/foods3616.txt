review/summary: Great Green Tea
review/text: I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/summary: Good Basic Tea
review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/text: I've only done this tea as a cold brew iced tea. There is no bitterness, just a smooth, refreshing, green taste. The ginger is very strong. I love ginger, so that is no problem for me. A second brew was significantly weaker, so I will stick to one brew per batch of leaves with this one (I am able to get three quality brews from many green teas).

review/summary: weak Earl Grey
review/text: This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not.

review/text: After having some incredible green tea with ginger at a restaurant, I began my search for something similar. I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/summary: Sweet Jasmine
review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

It can be left standing in its leaves longer without going bitter, I think its worth a try. I know I drink it all the time.

review/summary: I always come back to this tea
review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

review/summary: Quality Teas at Reasonable Prices
review/text: Stash is a decent brand of tea. We've got a number of their varieties in the house. We only use loose leaf and this doesn't have that tendency you sometimes get in loose leaf to be teeny tiny powder bits. You can actually tell that this was, at one time, a plant.<br /><br />It's got a good mild flavour that is just right near bedtime.

review/text: It's not bad, as the fragrance just hits you when the bag opens. That being said, way too many stems in the product. I'm not a tea expert, but I've bought enough and I think they have more stems than the average. I do like the eco-friendly no frill packaging with the zipper though.

review/text: My son drinks gallons of green tea.  We ordered one of the three-packs in the fall, and it was really good.  He was so impressed, we ordered it again. That (second) batch was disappointing - not nearly as full-flavored as the first.  I'm ordering it just one more time, hoping that the poorer quality was a fluke.

review/summary: Good tea.
review/text: This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. The tea itself is very good, but you must remember that this is Jasmine green tea... All in all I am happy with the purchase.

review/text: This is a quality tea that requires you to follow the directions.  My first attempt was by using my old method that works well with a different brand of tea.  In my opinion, when I did the job my old way the result was powerful (too strong).  After two more failed attempts I finally decided to read and follow the brief directions on the package. What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.

review/text: I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!

review/text: I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.

HOWEVER, I realized it was made in CHINA, where there have been catastrophic problems with the quality of the ingredients (especially the chicken) that has caused fatalities.<br />This item was sold in a store that claimed it no longer sold items from China and I am very disappointed.  This website of course does not make that claim, but it is difficult to see the miniscule print on the packaging that says 'Made in China' given that all the other print is very large and clear making it look like a top quality product.<br />I will not be buying Mellow Mutt again unless it is wholly manufactured here in the United States. Choose wisely, your dog trusts you.

You'll never want a breath saver or altoid to replace these once you try them.  I even take a couple on long runs just to have something to go with any extra water or a protein bar I might need.<br /><br />If you're a fan of anything or everything mint, you have to give these a try.

review/summary: More "fragrant" than flavorful
review/text: We bought this in hopes of turning our homemade lattes into white chocolate mochas, based on the rave reviews. I was disappointed by this product. It's not terrible, and does taste moderately decent, but really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I've had plenty of white chocolate mochas in my life, and this product just didn't deliver. We usually use organic brown sugar to sweeten our coffees, and in all honesty that tastes WAY better. And is a lot cheaper!<br />The powder is a strange mix of ingredients - none of them real white chocolate. I don't like the fact that it contains Partially Hydrogenated Oils, and, I don't even like using it because it feels like someone just shot a dustcan of vanilla up your nose every time you use it no matter how careful you are. Or like you've snorted vanilla talcum powder. The only thing I can compare it with, is the odd way that microwave popcorn flavoring used to get ya right in the nose, before they removed the diacetyl. ... It feels invasive and chemically induced LOL.<br />Also, when you taste the coffee you make with this product, you're more smelling than tasting. Try holding your nose. Yeah I know scent is a huge part of taste, but this product seems strangely reliant on its phony vanilla scent, and there's really no flavor without it. It also tastes and smells completely unnatural - fake chemical white chocolatey taste/smell instead of real white chocolatey taste/smell. I expected much more from a brand like Ghiradelli, and for the price.<br />It's not great for the waistline either, by adding a whopping 21 grams of carbohydrate to your cup of joe, and 2.5 grams of SATURATED fat per serving. My organic sugar adds between 4-8 grams of carbs, depending on whether I double the serving!<br />Overall, it's fun to try, but not when you have to buy this much of it at one time, and is now a 7/8 full tub of disappointment sitting on our countertop. It's best moment: We experimented and tried it on buttered popcorn. That was kind of good, made a sort of kettle corn taste, aside from the vanilla powder nasal invasion.<br /><br />I'm listing the ingredients here, because I really feel that calling this "ground white chocolate powder" is so misleading it's unfair to the consumer, and I don't see the ingredients shown in the listing.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Corn Syrup Solids, Sodium Caseinate, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Dipotassium Phosphate, Propylene Glycol Esthers of Fatty Acids (not kidding), Mono- and Di-Glycerides, Sodium Silico Aluminate (Mmmm), Salt, Soy Lecithin, Calcium Carageenan, and Artificial Color.<br /><br />Just a tip, consider trying organic brown sugar in your lattes and cappuchinos instead. Not the "sugar in the raw" brand, but a real organic brown. We find it adds a nice (natural) caramel-ly taste, kind of a cross between a Starbucks white chocolate mocha and caramel macchiato - very tasty.

review/summary: Tasty, but bad for you
review/text: Wow, this stuff makes very tasty frappes.  As long as you have a nice blender, the end product is as good as what you get in fancy coffee shops, only for a fraction of the price.<br /><br />I pretty much follow the recipe on the can (using skim milk), and it turns out plenty creamy.  The substitution I make is that, because I do not have an espresso maker, I use strong coffee.  I put in maybe a cup of coffee, and subtract some from the milk so it doesn't end up having too much liquid.<br /><br />The downside of this product is the trans and saturated fat.  I had no idea this things were so bad for me!<br /><br />Another approach to making frappes, without the saturated fat, is to mix hot coffee with chocolate pudding mix (not instant -- it has a terrible off taste!), then blend it up with some ice and milk.  It's probably not quite as good as with this mix, but it's way better for your heart.

Product has a good flavor when mixed according to directions: not too sweet. Be aware, this is a flavored powder, probably not white chocolate at all, because it contains no cocoa butter, which I believe is used to make white chocolate. White chocolate isn't chocolate at all. The first three ingredients of this product are sugar, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, and corn syrup solids. You decide whether the price for this is a good value, or whether this is really a white chocolate product or, as the label states, "SWEET GROUND WHITE CHOCOLATE" followed by the very important word, in smaller print, "FLAVOR." We will continue to search for the perfect white chocolate flavoring for our mochas, but we are pleased with this one.

review/summary: Very satiating
review/text: This makes for some great hot chocolate when mixed with whole milk.  But what i was most impressed about is if you substitute this mix for Hershey's cocoa powder when making cookies they come out fantabulous!  Haven't substituted this for any other recipes, but you bet i will when the time comes.  Kind of pricey, but worth it if you dont go through it fast.

review/summary: smooth and creamy drinks!
review/text: This is what can turn your blended drinks from slushies (mostly ice) to smooth, creamy and delicious! A friend who owned a coffee shop sold me some of this and it makes all the difference. I was just on the Ghirardelli website and they have an extensive list of drinks - coffee and non - to make using this product. I think the one I'll try next is the 50/50 which is like a dreamsicle! Yum, yum!

review/summary: Like having a coffee shop in my own house.
review/text: I used to buy a mocha frappe every single day at my local coffee shop. Needless to say, it was expensive. I had tried many different ways of making it at home and none of them worked until this product. The consistency of it is perfect and it doesn't melt before I'm done drinking it. Just like the ones I get at the cofffee shop, it stays thick until the very last drop. The chocolatey flavor is perfection in my opinion... and I'm very picky, having tasted many of these over the years.<br /><br />Also, one of the problems that I used to have trying to make mocha frappe's at home was that the ice would never get very well blended because my blender is a cheaper one, and I couldn't afford to buy a nice one like those in coffee shops that cost hundreds of dollars. With Ghirardelli frappe mix I don't have that problem anymore. Even with a cheaper blender all the ice gets perfectly blended.<br /><br />I'm not even sure just how much money I've saved since I stopped visiting the coffee shop every day and started using this product, but I know it's a huge amount.

review/summary: Great Stuff - and Can Size is Fine
review/text: I bought this when the pack of 6 cans Amazon offers was unavailable, because we're not sure life is worth living without Ghiradelli chocolate in our morning coffee, and Amazon's prices are so much more reasonable than those in local stores.  I was worried about the can size - but the three-pound is really just as convenient - it barely takes up more space than the one-pound cans on my kitchen counter.  (Granted, if I were keeping it in a cabinet, it would be a tighter fit - but still, it's not as bulky as one might expect.)  And the chocolate, of course, is wonderful.  Ghiradelli makes the best!

review/summary: The best for cake baking!
review/text: For whatever reason, our local stores stopped selling this particular Ghirardelli product years ago. I suspect the price??? In any case, my kids always looked forward to the Empress Chocolate Cake that I'd make for their birthdays. The recipe was printed on the can at that time. So when one of them mentioned that they'd *sure* *love* to have one of those cakes again (code for "pleeeeeeeeeease mommy!" that they can't say anymore because they're a bit older) I found the recipe online and came straight here to see it I could get the powder here. And, yay! Here it is! Let the summer birthday season in our family begin!

review/summary: Being my own barista is so much better!
review/text: I love this product! I actually discovered it back in college as it was what my favorite coffee cart lady used in her "white caps". It is smooth and has a light flavor. It is sweet enough that you don't need any extra sugar and I like to add just a dash of cream, too. There is no such thing as real "white chocolate" so people who are expecting a heavy chocolate flavor might do best to stick with the regular brown stuff. No, it is not great for you, but I cannot imagine anyone that thinks most of the coffee drinks found in your favorite shops are "good for you". They are a treat and are meant to be enjoyed as such.

review/summary: Not the same as Ghirardelli white chocolate chips
review/text: I thought the powder would contain the same ingredients as the white chocolate chips made by the same company Ghirardelli, but they don't.  The powder and the chips are 2 different products.<br /><br />My favorite drink at Starbucks is White Chocolate Mocha, so I always wanted to make a copycat version at home.  In my opinion, the chips tastes so much closer to Starbucks' white mocha.  The powder doesn't even taste like white chocolate.  I wanted to buy the powder so that I can dissolve it easier, but didn't realize the powder and the chips are two different products.  I'm disappointed that Ghirardelli called both the chips and the powder "white chocolate," because it's misleading.<br /><br />If you want to make White Chocolate Mocha like Starbucks', you would need to get the white chocolate chips, not powder.  Also, Ghirardelli's white chips are way better than Nestle's white chips.

review/summary: Good tea value
review/text: We purchased this as an alternative to the Revolution Brand of the same tea. The price difference is amazing for buying bulk loose tea so we decided we had to give it a try. By way of comparison, we loved the Rev brand. The Davidson's tea lavender smell is much stronger (not so much after the tea is steeped) and the tea itself has a touch more bite even when only steeped for one minute than the rev brand. Rev brand had a smoother taste with a more muted lavender.  The other thing to point out is this is classified as organic whereas the Rev brand is not for this type of tea.<br /><br />In the end we will probably switch. We drink 3-4 cups of tea a day, we like the idea of organic vs non, and we like the loose tea as opposed to the nylon bags that Rev uses.

review/summary: Soothing Flowery Tea
review/text: I got a bag of this tea from my friend's purchase. He felt the the scent of lavender was too strong.  On the contrary, I find the flowery scent matches the coolness/smoothness of earl grey very well.  It is certainly not a version of earl grey with a hint of lavender.  The lavender is the leader here, which is what I've been looking for.  Again, this purely depends on personal preference.  If you want more herb and less tea, then this can be for you.<br /><br />I can get 3 cups out of a tablespoon of the tea leaves.  After that it'll just be water. This lavender tea with honey is now my favorite drink when I have a headache.  It definitely soothes my mind.  I don't feel the caffaine is too strong as sometimes I drink it in the evening and still can go to sleep on time.  I'm very happy to have tried it and will definitely order some myself once this batch runs out.

review/summary: You get more than what you pay for
review/text: This tea brews up to a nice reddish or dark yellow tint, and if steeped for an appropriate time it is quite good. I've found that I prefer a shorter steeping time vs. most other black loose teas. There is some inconsistency between batches even from the same bag. Sometimes you get more Bergamot oil flavor, sometimes more lavender and tannins. This might be a consequence of inconsistency in steeping times or tea quantity on my part, but I think it's actually the tea itself. I like the variety as it keeps me from getting bored. I tend to prefer ~2 minutes steeping in my French press and reuse it 2 or 3 times. The 2nd steeping is often the best.<br /><br />For under $20 per lb, I'd be happy if this were just OK tea. However, it's actually quite good. It is certainly the best value I've found so far.

review/text: Once again I'm thrilled with Davidson's! I've ordered three pounds of tea and each one is as delicious as the next. Who would't want a tastier and cheaper alternative to bagged tea?<br /><br />Looks pretty in a glass container, loose. I drink at least 8 cups of tea per day since I discovered Davidson's. Perfect to add some aroma and reduce cravings at my desk job. I wish I could give them more business but their product is inexpensive and lasts forever. I resteep leaves 2-4 times. The photo is misleading, they come in airtight plastic/foil lined paper bags with a resealable zip seal. I keep mine in containers though.<br /><br />I started with the Moroccan Green w/Mint, which is mild in flavor and only slightly minty. It's my go-to tea. The Earl Grey w/Lavender is bold and leaves a fresh taste in the mouth. The Cranberry Orange herbal is perfect for relaxing or curbing sugar cravings later in the day.<br /><br />Davidson's made me a tea snob. I wish I could get more, but I'll have to wait months or years until I run out!
