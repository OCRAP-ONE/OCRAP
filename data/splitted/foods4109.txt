review/summary: Tasty yes, hot... meh...
review/text: I did a fair amount of research before purchasing the Holy Jolokia sauce.  I selected this because it was pure Bhut Jolokia, not cut with Habaneros or other.  Given that the bhut jolokia is rated at 1,000,000 SHU, I was expecting some FIRE.  Tabasco sauce is up to 5,000 SHU.  Tabasco Habanero sauce is 7,000+.  This should be BLAZING.  Instead it is somewhere between original tabasco and tabasco habanero sauce.  Maybe 6,000 SHU.<br /><br />It has a mildly sweet flavor and a hint of orange and the heat hits differently, more on the tip of the tongue and the back of the throat.  The burn dissipates quickly and there's no real "morning after" problems.<br /><br />To be rather honest, I was expecting more.

review/summary: Versatile and delicious
review/text: I probably have a half-dozen varieties of jolokia sauce in the house right now (plus quite a few other hot sauces from different peppers). Holy Jolokia, a CaJohns product, is probably my favorite of the lot.<br /><br />A portion of the proceeds from its sale go to benefit the Chili Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University, so that's a plus.<br /><br />The sauce is a pure jolokia, with no other peppers, but a hint of lemon extract. It's a little thicker than CaJohns' Naga Soreass, and similar in consistency to Frank's Red Hot. The heat is pleasantly strong but nowhere near as fiery as other jolokia sauces. The flavor hits the perfect notes of smokiness for a jolokia sauce, and the ingredients list is the shortest of any of the sauces I own--usually a very good sign.<br /><br />Most of these sauces come in 5 oz bottles and will last me a year--I expect this bottle to be gone inside two months.

review/summary: If you are looking for a heat fix, this is not it
review/text: I am a bit of a hot food aficionado.  I long moved off regular Tabasco and now need the habanero Tabasco to get a decent burn.  So after reading about the jolokia pepper I eagerly ordered this sauce, paying through the nose given the extra shipping cost. However I was very disappointed. I find the habanero Tabasco to be hotter than this stuff.  I'm looking for something to knock my socks off, the kind of heat level that you sort of regret having put in your mouth after doing so. This is not it.  Even ten drops of the stuff in a sauce on my own plate doesn't do much for me.  So I wont be ordering this again.<br /><br />(UPDATE - getting near the end of the bottle now, and I have to say taste-wise, I'm starting to quite like it.  However, I don't like it enough to pay the Amazon shipping fees, and it's not sold in any supermarkets near me, so I doubt I will be ordering this again.  Suggestion to the makers, if they ever read these comments: dispense with the labelling which makes it seem like a rival to the "Dave's" line of hot sauces when it blatantly isn't, and just market it on the basis of the taste.)

review/text: As somone who loves hot foods, I was looking forward to my first taste of jolokia hot sauce.  Imagine my suprise, when I doused a tortilla chip with some Holy Jolokia.  I thought somone had slipped some dull Tabasco or other innocuous sauce in place of the real thing.  It had some flavor but no more heat than the plethora of other middle heat sauces that claim to be "hot".<br />The flavor was more like habanero....only much tamer.  And to think this was developed be the Univ. of Arizona's hot pepper research lab.  Very disappointing.

review/text: I got these in the mail yesterday.  I have two golden retrievers, one a year old and one 13 years old.  The 13 year old is very fussy about treats and food.  I opened one of these bags of Turkey Chips and had both sitting waiting.  I gave one to the old dog and he ate it instantly, I gave one to the young one and he dropped it by mistake and the old one moved quicker than I have seen him move in months to grab that one on the floor before my young one could pick it up.  Obviously, they are a hit with both dogs and I can see the four bags I bought won't last long and I'll be re ordering.

review/summary: These are not supposed to be hard
review/text: These came today and my mouth just started to water.  These are in the top three favorite candies of all time for me.  I thought they would come in a 1 lb. package they were just tossed in the box and shipped, to me that is not sanitary, they did not even try to put them in a plastic bag, and they were not the full lb. I  paid for.  That is why they should  be shipped in the original one pound bag.<br /><br />Bull's eyes are an acquired taste, they are not really a caramel candy they are a sort of caramel candy. but they are supposed to be soft, you are not supposed to break your jaw trying to take a bite. I buy these because they are supposed to be soft and I can only chew on soft candies, I had trouble with my jaw slipping when I tried to chew these, I can't finish them.,  what a waste.<br /><br />In their own words:<br />August Goetze purchased the Baltimore Chewing Gum Company five generations ago in 1895. Goetze's passion ultimately led him to focus on perfecting a single candy. With soft, chewy caramel wrapped around a sweet fondant center, Caramel Creams� were born. Their unique taste has been delighting candy fans ever since - and setting the standard for consistent quality in the American candy business.<br /><br />It is very hard to find these little gems where I live, but when I do I always find them soft and very satisfying. I guess my getting them hard is not the usual if you see the reviews soft the other buyers.  Unfortunately I did get a bad batch and I will not be buying them here again.

The centers are smooth and creamy, and the caramel exteriors are just awesome.  You have to be careful regarding the freshness, however, because this is definitely one candy that HAS to be fresh.  You'll wind up needed jaw surgery if they're stale!  LOVE these guys, highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: Good, but very spicy. Prep issues
review/text: I've tried at least six other varieties in the Maruchan Yakisoba product line. Maruchan Yakisoba Beef Taco flavor is far and away the spiciest of the ones I've tried. It's also the only one that consistently boils over when prepared according to the package instructions. There must be something in the dry ingredients packet that causes water to boil more quickly (the instructions -- a cup of water, dry ingredients pack, and four minutes, are basically the same on all varieties). Cutting the time down to three minutes and thirty seconds seems to eliminate the problem in my Panasonic microwave, but you'll just have to experiment to find what time works best in your own oven.<br /><br />I like these, but I definitely need to be in a mood for a spicy meal to enjoy them. I usually have frozen chopped onions and bell peppers in my freezer; sometimes I'll add about a quarter cup of them to the yakisoba pan before cooking, making for an even spicier dish.

review/summary: The hottest flavor they have
review/text: I echo what other people have said both about the heat of this product and the prep issues.  It will consistently boil over if you follow the package directions, whereas other flavors in this line do not.  I have tried teriyaki beef, chicken, roast chicken, and spicy chicken, as well as this flavor.  I have an 1150 watt microwave and I have success by peeling the lid about 75% off, then  running it for about 5 minutes at 60 or 70% power.  For my microwave, that means that it'll run for a while, then just spin without the microwaves, then turn it back on.  It doesn't constantly run at a lower power.  The water will boil up the side but the microwave usually phases it off before it boils over, then it restarts when it's settled, and the longer cooking time compensates for the lower %.  It doesn't work every time but it's better than the alternative-watching it constantly.  On to the heat- it's surprisingly hot, and I like spicy stuff.  It will definitely turn some people off.  I find if I add some additional vegetables it cuts the heat a bit.  My favorite is quartered steamed brussels sprouts.

review/text: These are great if you like a little spice to your noodles.  The product overall is not quite enough for a lunch, it would be nice if there were a little more to the meal.  The issue I have is in preparation.  I have made many of these, and almost every time I am sure to prepare it exactly as instructed and each time the water ends up boiling over the side, making a mess of the seasoning all along the edge of the bowl and leaving the liquid in the bottom of the microwave for cleanup.  They are good enough that I don't mind the cleanup, but, you would think they would package it a little differently so there wouldn't be issues.  I have tried a little less water, which usually helps, but it leaves the noodles a little dry.  Regardless, I would recommend these, just put a few paper towels under the package when microwaving.

review/text: I have been eating this brand of instant Yakisoba for awhile now, but had never heard of the Beef Taco flavor.  Based on the unbeatable price (subscribed at under $6 per 8 pack), I was intrigued, but also afraid it may have been priced so low because it was unpopular.  I gave it a shot and I had to write a review on it.  While not my favorite Yakisoba flavor (spicy chicken), it's a real nice flavor. It is possibly a tad salty, even by ramen/instant noodle standards, but the difference between this and your usual 'fake umami' flavor that most of these go for is enjoyable for a change.

This was my first time trying these noodles and after my first bowl I'm sticking them in the back of the pantry to eat when I've run out of everything else. I mean they're edible if you just want something microwavable, fast and decently priced, but if you're someone with a sensitive palate or stomach(or actually want to taste your food) go for a different flavor.

review/text: Brought this to work and after giving everyone a bag to try, I had them clamoring for more!!  It's so flavorful and has just the right amount of caffeine kick to tide me over after the lunch stupor.  I'll definitely order again though I'll be a bit stingier with sharing the next time around :-)

review/summary: Our kitty love it
review/text: My kitten, Poppy, liked to steal the lamb based kibble that my dogs ate.  I've always fed the animals the highest quality foods and I went on a search to find a lamb based cat food for him.<br /><br />Acana fits the bill.  The aroma of the kibbles is a bit strong, but he LOVES it.  He changed over from his other kibble (Evo) just fine, litter box odor is absent, which is wonderful with an indoor cat.<br /><br />His coat is super shiny.  His white fur is very white, his black fur is super shiny.  His teeth, ears, everything is in great shape.  Love this food and will keep it in his rotation.

review/summary: Taste Was Very Good.
review/text: During my last trip to our local grocery store, I picked up a Maruchan Yakisoba Noodle Bowl (sweet and sour chicken flavor) just out of curiosity, and I had it for a light lunch today. It was quite good and took only four minutes to prepare. The sweet and sour taste was very good. It was too high in sodium, of course, which is typical of these prepared bowls. Probably half the packet of flavoring is salt. So, I watch my salt intake for the rest of the day when I have one of these. On the other hand, it had 6 grams of protein, which was high for a dish like this. All in all, it made a good, but not a great, lunch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I, myself am not from latin america so I didn't grow up on this or anything. To be honest, it tastes like sugary vegetable soup with tonic water. kinda of tastes like caramel as well. If you never tried this I suggest not trying it. I had this drink 10 minutes ago and my stomach hurts and every burp makes me feel nauseas. I feel that tomorrow, my stomach will not agree with me. If you ever feel the need to puke I suggest drinking this. I apologize if I am offending anyone but it seriously doesn't taste good.

review/text: I became a big fan of "jamaica" juice after being introduced to it in Mexico a few years back, so I had to jump on this when I saw it. It tastes very similar to real hibiscus juice, and is not too sweet like a lot of hibiscus concentrates are. It's slightly tart, but not as much as cranberry juice is (it's not bitter either).<br /><br />I use this in Italian sodas, and couldn't be happier with it.

review/text: Cherry-Lime Rickey is probably my favorite soda flavor. I used to love the Hickory Farms brand, and Pop Shoppe made a nice one too. With those long gone (at least in my market) I've long been in search of a replacement. The Torani Cherry-Lime version is good, but it's not great. Somehow it misses that crisp flavor that I associate with Cherry-Lime. That said, I do enjoy this flavor. It gets a 75% in our house - one person thinks it has an aftertaste.

Well that has all changed now that I have tasted this almond spread.<br />the creamy rich taste of almonds along with the caramel flavor of the spread makes it so hard to not just sit down with a spoon and have at it.<br />i now have to find places that sell it at a reasonable price on line. I live just far enough away from stores to make this a cost effective method of buying this spread.<br />i hope this isn't another product that I really like and then they quit making it. my recomendation is to get it now and try it..it is amazing, who knew that something so good for you could taste this good as well.

review/text: I don't know what's in here besides caramel and ground up almonds but it is DELISH! A bit lighter in taste than peanut butter, the caramel gives this nut spread a bit more depth in addition to the expected sweetness. This morning I used it on some waffles and found it to be a good substitute for peanut butter (which I also use from time to time). I would not recommend using with jelly or jam - perhaps a fruit butter that is not too sweet. Tomorrow I'll try it with some apple or blueberry butter we have, but today it was so delicious I couldn't ruin my first experience with fruit! Try it!

It tastes like preservatives. It's cheap "natural caramel flavor" spread. It leaves a terrible aftertaste in your mouth. I took one serving and threw the entire jar away... there's no way I'm going to even finish it. Gross.

review/text: This is my favorite bouillon, and I am surprised at its strength!<br /><br />I was having troubles digesting Rapunzel bouillon cubes, which used to be my favorite... better than bouillon was great, but didn't have the rounded flavor....<br /><br />This Marigold stuff is definitely the best, and has a very nice background of herbs and spices that makes it truly delicious.  I found reference to it in the Plenty cookbook.  Reading the label, I am surprised that they include nutmeg and lovage.. it really is a nice blend for all my vegan soups, even my Thai basil coconut soup.<br /><br />The only think you should know if you are worried about salt is that it has 459 mg per serving (4.5g), and it does pack a punch.  Flavor-wise, you really get a nice kick with this stuff, so you don't need to much, but it is savory and salty, so just be aware.

Once it's dissolved in water, however, it smells great and has a really nice, savory flavor. There's a hint of mint to it that I don't particularly care for (I believe it's the lovage). I add quite a bit of really good Italian herb mix to it then put it back in the can to bring to work. It makes a nice afternoon snack. The lid seals well and it stays fresh for a long time.

review/text: It is one of those elusive finds: A decent commercial vegetable broth.  Most tend to be bland, sweet, or taste metallic.  Plus most are very high sodium.  Marigold Swiss Vegetable Bouillon power is a stand-out exception.<br /><br />This is good enough to make a cup to sip on.  It is flavorful without being too strong.  It does not have any medicinal flavor, and is not sweet.  It just tastes like a good vegetable broth. It is a light color.  Of course it is not clear, coming from a powder, so don't expect that.<br /><br />The sodium level is roughly 500 mg per 'serving'.  I would still love to find a bouillon that is actually 'low sodium' and not merely 'reduced sodium'.  But overall, this is a keeper.

I'd like to get the packets of rim flavoring that go with these flavors without having to buy 6 tins of each.

I kept it simple and made various flavored 'tinis using the 2:1 ratio suggested on the label recipe. The Blueberry and Passion Fruit were a little sweet for 'my' taste, but I added a bit of lime to balance the flavor.<br /><br />Amoretti were so helpful when I spoke to them about my thoughts regarding the flavors. As a smaller family owned company, I could tell that they really cared and wanted to make sure their customers are taken care of. I will *definitely* be recommending their products to my friends and will be trying out the many other flavors they have available.<br /><br />Give these a try.

review/text: one of the best pho soup bases I have found . each jar has 2 spice mix in their own bag plus a dry base of ingredients that make- up the<br />pho soup base.  For me I use a half of the pho soup base jar at a time which is about 4 quarts give or take how much water you add. I refrigerator what I don't use for later.<br /><br />I do freeze/or refrigerate the remainder of the jar dried soup base after it is open this help it not dry out as fast.I also put a baggie around the jar to help. Works good for me.<br /><br />Each time has been great. Good on my stomach, too.<br /><br />If you think the 4 jars (pack)is to much you can mix them up. If you like pho soup you will use this up fast and I think you will enjoy it<br />I do.

review/summary: Pork Rinds - Barbeque Flavor
review/text: This order was the first order I had placed with Amazon.  I was pleased with the time it took the order to arrive, and with the quality of the food.  The only thing that I was disappointed with was that the advertisement promised free S&H for orders over a set price.  However, after I placed my order I was notified that my order did not qualify for the free S&H offer, even though it exceeded the price minimum, because (I believe) it was a food product.<br />I hope that by the time I want more of this item, that I can find it in a local supermarket again, as the total order was a little pricey!!

review/summary: Garlic gets even better than better
review/text: I ran into this at my local Whole Foods for $6.99(MSRP regular price) and thought I love garlic I'll give this a try.  Fermenting cabbage turns a lack luster vegetable into a nutritious powerhouse superfood of Sauerkraut so starting out with a superfood such as garlic has got to end up with a super superfood!  right!  I made some homemade onion soup and threw a couple of black garlic in there and let me tell you is tastes super delicious!  I may have found it for the nutrition but I am going to buy again and again for the delicious flavor!  Look at all the great recipes on their website too!<br /><br />Black Garlic Kale<br /><br />Black Garlic T-Bone Steak"- Mini Superior Farms Lamb T-Bone with sugared mint sea salt, gold dusted micro greens, and Black Garlic fondu.<br /><br />Black Garlic, Crunchy Vegetable and Sesame Noodle Salad -This salad makes a good light lunch for two people.<br /><br />Mushroom and Black Garlic Risotto -add extra flavor to your Risotto<br /><br />Creamy Cheese and Black Garlic Dip - Black Garlic flavored cream cheese?<br /><br />Scallops with Black Garlic and Chorizo - This is an ideal starter for two or a pre-dinner nibble. It is also excellent as a lunch, served with a lemon vinaigrette rocket salad.<br /><br />Lamb and Black Garlic Fajitas - These make an excellent lunchtime treat. Great for children! You can substitute the lamb for chicken or for a vegetarian version add different vegetables such as mange tout and baby corn.<br /><br />Fillet of beef with a Black Garlic Mushroom Duxelle served with a Black Garlic Port Wine sauce<br /><br />Black Garlic Stuffed Mushrooms - Exotic mixture of taste between black garlic and mushrooms<br /><br />Black Garlic Linguine - You have had a busy day; don't feel like cooking. Think Black Garlic! This dish is quick, easy and very tasty!<br /><br />I may have one of these for dinner tonight!  YUMMY!  I am a huge garlic fan and have even been teased "oh so you are having a little linquine with your garlic?" because I used a whole head of garlic.  However, I am not a fan of roasted garlic really or elephant garlic either.  My new favorite garlic is now Black Garlic!<br /><br />UPDATE 4/11  These have become one of my favorite foods.  They are sweet and taste incredible chopped up on top of margarita pizza!

review/summary: gourmet garlic even if you thought you hated garlic
review/text: Review Update: 5/2/2012: Culinary Elite brand black garlic on Amazon is a better value than this one is now. You get 2.2 oz for $6.75 on Amazon and their shipping is cheaper and it comes peeled so you are not paying for the majority of the weight in stuff you throw out like the core and peels. You wind up getting twice as much black garlic for half the price by ordering Culinary Elite. This one is good too but it is unpeeled and comes in a bag rather than a  tub and the weight you pay for includes the cores and the peels and the stems in this brand.  I liked it, but Culinary Elite is a better value.<br /><br />Black garlic is super soft so it's very difficult to peel if you buy it unpeeled. No matter what brand you get, I suggest buying peeled only. It's a mess to peel and gets all under your nails if it's really fresh black garlic.<br /><br />Original review:<br />---------------------<br /><br />Black garlic may sound odd but one bite and you'll be an addict.<br /><br />You may have seen it on cooking shows by elite chefs; it's not easy to find unless you are in a very nice restaurant...or my kitchen. Because I'm a huge fan. And now, apparently, on Amazon too.<br /><br />Used in China for quite some time, it is used originally as a homeopathic cancer fighter due to it's richness in antioxidants and fighter of free radicals.<br /><br />But one taste and you'll be in heaven.<br /><br />It takes over a month to make one clove. Why? It is heated the ENTIRE time in a high humidity low temperature oven.  This acts like a balsamic vinegar reduction where you start with something a bit bitter and end up with something rich and sweet...in fact, it tastes much like a balsamic vinegar reduction/garlic fusion.<br /><br />Unlike regular garlic that exudes from your pores and is bitter, this is smooth and doesn't hang around long or emit a pore smell either! You can date and eat it! Woo Hoo! But it's so tender and sweet you can literally pop a clove in your mouth and chew and not grimace.  It's slightly jelly like and can be easily mixed in ANYTHING to make it better. I love it on pizza, in pasta, in green beans, mashed potatoes...my dad puts it on all steaks now.<br /><br />You can literally put a lot in anything and it wakes up the flavor beautifully and wonderfully...<br /><br />It is not mixed with anything...just pure garlic, cooked slowly for an exceptionally long time to make it rich, smooth, and molasses-like sweet.

review/summary: Pleasant All Round Flavor - Good Value
review/text: I love chili dishes of all kinds.  This chili powder has a nice rounded flavor. It tastes quite mild to me.  It makes a great base for a milder chili dish. But if a person wants more heat, that can be achieved with additional chipotles, cumin, cayenne or a variety of fresh peppers for additional heat and character.  It's all up to the cook how the dish ends up.<br />Whether you prefer mild chili dishes (or like me) plenty of heat, this is a great spice base and the large jar is an excellent value. If you like heat, keep cans of chipotle peppers or chiplotle powder for 'customizing".<br />I will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Best Marshmallows Ever
review/text: Title says it all.<br /><br />I'm a vegetarian and have been missing marshmallows, and not just for cocoa.  I used to make a fantastic fudge but with no marshmallows, well, no fudge.  I picked up a bag of these at my local natural food store.  I've been looking at them suspiciously for a couple of months now and finally caved last week.<br /><br />These are the best ever!  I've been eating them like candy.  Oh, wait!  They are candy.  I'm picking up some graham crackers and will be fixing some s'mores real soon.<br /><br />I hope that Amazon gets some soon.<br /><br />November 2011 Update:<br /><br />I am tempted to take away a star for changes that I've experience with the Dandies marshmallows in the past few months.  They've become smaller in size.  Not having any of the older ones handy (not surprising), my guess is that they are 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the earlier Dandies.  They also appear to be using less of whatever they were using to coat the marshmallows.  For the past few months, the Dandies have been stuck together.  Now that is not a problem if cooking with them is the plan; however if the plan is for s'mores, cocoa topping, or even just munching, it is a problem.

review/text: So I'm not a vegan, just vegetarian, but I've been missing marshmallows for a while. Why we feel the need to stick ground up animal bones (gelatin) into food is ridiculous and unnecessary, but that's another debate.<br /><br />Anyway, I saw these in the store tonight and hesitantly purchased it, honestly thinking they would suck. Oh how I was wrong. These are delicious. They're fluffy, creamy and taste great. The only thing that could make these better would be if they were organic.<br /><br />They were pricey (at least locally, at the moment Amazon is out of stock so I don't know their pricing) but I would definitely buy these again.

Although not a vegan, I try to shop at health food stores as much as my wallet allows, and I came across these when my 6 year old pulled them off the shelf, begging for them. Needless to say, when I tried one, I became addicted, and in 2 days, the bag is now empty. I tried these on my favorite pumpkin pie, chocolate bar, and sweet potato thus far, and they truly enhance the flavor of a lot of food. You've got to try these!

review/summary: Better Than Gelatin Marshmallows
review/text: I was extremely happy to chance upon these in a health food store shortly before I was going camping. Like many of the other reviewers before me, I haven't had marshmallows in a long time because of my commitment to vegetarianism. These marshmallows can toast in the fire just like gelatin marshmallows do! Personally, I think they taste better because I always found gelatin marshmallows a little chalky. These seem less prone to becoming stale--I stored mine for a month after opening them, and they always tasted fine. You do pay more for these marshmallows, but the $11.99 I see on Amazon right now is even steeper than the price I paid. They were $4 or $5 at the health food store.

review/summary: Small. Not good for campfire.
review/text: Taste is excellent, very good, but the size is too small. I wanted these for a campfire, but I couldn't find a big size marshmallow inside the package.  During summer time, it melts easily inside the package. Even though I kept them in the refrigerator until it was time for the campfire, I had to throw away 1/3 of the package, since it turned into a huge marshmallow sticky ball.  I paid $13 on an external website (including S/H). It was not worth it.  Next time I will try Sweet and Sara.
