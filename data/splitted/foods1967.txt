review/summary: A Favorite Treat
review/text: Our dog loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q7YFLQ">Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, 4-Ounce Package</a>, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is working on training their dog. The ingredients are healthy, and apparently it is quite tasty.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, because the treats are a little larger than I would like. Of course, you can just break them in pieces to make great rewards. They crumble a bit, but those crumbs still work! Our dog still hasn't got all of the commands down, but at least she looked forward to the training.

review/summary: Don't let the large size put you off.....
review/text: These were recommended as suitable for cats, but when I received them, they appeared to be far too large for my kids, so I tried them on the dogs of a few acquaintances, and they absolutely loved them(and now love me)! I realized that these are easily broken up into smaller pieces, so I tossed some bits in the kitties' dishes, and they also clamored for more, unlike most "cat treats". I'd say give them a try!

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: I like that these are healthy, pure freeze-dried chicken that I can feed my dogs. My dogs go nuts for them. The treats are too big to give my dogs a whole one but that's okay because they break up very easily. I break them into fourths and give them a fourth at a time.

review/summary: Great ingredients, but cats can be finicky
review/text: What I find attractive about this product is that the right combination of protein, fat and fiber for your pet. The ingredients read like a list of actual recognizable foods such as plants and animals that you would actually buy in the supermarket rather than a long list of artificial ingredients you would never use in a recipe. Aside from one mineral and one natural preservative, the are things I'd gladly eat myself.<br /><br />The down side of the product is that my cats wouldn't eat it. In fairness, cats can be finicky, and of the three cat treats I have in my house, one cat won't eat any of them. The other likes just one. Obviously I wouldn't buy them, but it's well worth a try especially if you have dogs. If your pet does end up liking them, you can feel good knowing that they are getting real food that a chef might have come up with for their health, rather than something that a laboratory invented.

review/summary: Raw Healthy Freeze dried snack ...but so expensive
review/text: Nature's Variety Snacks seem to have the right ingredients. My dogs were barely interested in the treats.<br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I've always known that cats need more protein than dogs.<br />Granted this is just a treat but I would think that is why few treats and designed<br />for dogs/cats. I was shocked to realize at the current price these treat cost over $43 per pound.<br />Why not save money and buy your pets Filet mignon or the finest wild Alaskan Salmon.<br />I'm exaggerating of course but I hope you get my point. You could buy a food dehydrator<br />and make your own beef or chicken treats for your pet.

review/summary: Like the concept
review/text: I really like the concept of this brand. In fact, I was quite thrilled reading all of the ingredients.<br /><br />The biscuits are dry and a bit on the hard side, but despite being a bit older, my dog ate any that were proffered to him. The crunchy bits are probably good for cleaning his teeth. He's a 10+ year old 80lb Doberman-Weimaraner mix and not a picky eater, but he wasn't overly excited when offered the treats. Maybe he was just wary of the new food. He seemed relatively pleased after the first taste because he begged for another. However, later that night he had a bit of an upset stomach and had to go out more than once.<br /><br />I know that dogs may typically have a range of upsetting digestive reactions to new foods. I'd advise only offering one or two treats until their digestive system has a chance to adjust.<br /><br />I think I'm going to give it a few more days to see if he adjusts and still can happily enjoy the treats because I'd much rather give him these than the fake bacon garbage.

review/summary: My 3 dogs loved these
review/text: I have a bullmastiff, Rottweiler, and shih tzu who looooved these. Not many come in the bag so if you have big dogs they might not be worth it to spend money on, but I broke these into quarters for my shih tzu. Due to so many pet food and treat recalls over the last couple years I am wary about many things I feed my pets. These being made in the U.S. made me more comfortable than some things made in China. I will stock these for my small dog but at the price they are now I won't buy them for my large dogs.

review/summary: Neighbor's cat don't like it
review/text: Well, we do not have cats of our own, but our neighbor's cat frequently visits us. I thought it would be nice to feed her something wholesome, organic and healthy from time to time, so we tried the Raw Boost Bites. She didn't like it. Nibbled a bit on it and then spewed it out in disgust. We had more success with the customary tuna fish and ham diet.<br />I have to admit that the sample size of one is not really representative, so I have no idea whether this cat has a special taste, or whether this product is just not what cats want. I may need to try it myself to get a better idea about it ...

review/summary: My Dog Liked these, my Cat, not so much
review/text: My dog liked the Raw Boost Bites, eagerly eating them out of my hand.  She is a treat hound, and likes these as well as any other treat product.  My cat ignored the treats, as she does most treat products.<br /><br />The advantage to these Bites are the fact that they are freeze-dried at the factory, and retain a level of freshness until the package is opened.  It's a little difficult to open the package, but I was eventually successful without resorting to a pair of scissors, which was nice.<br /><br />The smell of the product was as one would expect, with a musky meat (Chicken) flavor that presumably is irresistible to dogs (if not cats).  Not something I'd be attracted to, but then again the product is meant to appeal to your animal friend rather than you.

review/summary: Best treats yet for cats and dogs....
review/text: This is by far one of the best treats. What is best is that they are for both cats and dogs. Usually when I give my dog or cat a treat they eat it right on the spot. When I first gave them these treats, my dog and cat ran away with these treats on hand. They left and probably savored them in private. The treats are great and they are the size of a half dollar and about a half inch to three quarters inch thick. You can probably cut these in pieces perfectly using a knife. If you do it by hand it takes a little more strength and maybe a little messier. Overall, these are great treats that you can use for your cat and dog.

review/summary: Natural pet treats
review/text: These "bites" are almost Oreo cookie sized.  As they are, they aren't the best size or shape for cats, though these are marketed for both cats and dogs.  I crumbled one of these up and dropped them in front of the kitties.  Only a few of the kitties seemed to like the crumbles.  A couple of them weren't interested after their initial sniff.  A few of them tried to give the crumbles a second chance.<br /><br />I think these would be better for dogs.  While the concept of natural and raw is awesome, the shape and texture isn't the best for cats.<br /><br />ETA - I gave these to a friend who has 2 puppies, and they LOVED it.  She has 8 cats as well, and though the cats were interested, they didn't care that much.  I had given this 3 stars for the cats, but if you have dogs, they are definitely 5 stars.  So this review is for 4 stars.

review/summary: My cats LOVEEEEE this
review/text: I have 3 cats. And they all are now obsessed with this. I got the chicken flavor and I crumble one biscuit up, splitting it 3 ways and put it on top of their wet food. I feed them wet food only, but one of the cats is a dry food/dry treat addict. I give her small amounts of grain-free dry food occasionally to satisfy her, but now I think I'll switch to this! I think she just needs something with a harder texture and this is perfect.

review/summary: Good Quality, But Expensive
review/text: We got the Raw Boost Bites in chicken flavor.  Although my dogs will eat anything, they were especially excited about these treats.<br /><br />The quality of ingredients is excellent.  No grains--just freeze-dried meats, fruits and veggies, with some spices, and preserved with vitamin E.  They smell VERY chicken-y, moreso than conventional treats.  The freeze-drying gives these biscuits an odd texture, kind of like cardboard.  They hardly weigh anything.<br /><br />While the quality is good, there are a couple of negatives.  First is the cost.  My box only contained 18 treats.  I have two big dogs, so if I gave them each three cookies/day (not unusual), this box would last us... three days.  Second, while the size is fine for a larger dog, you'd have to break them for a smaller dog.  This makes a huge, crumbly mess.  Third, after eating one, both dogs do this weird smacking thing with their tongues for a full minute, as if part of the treat is stuck to the roof of their mouths.  I don't know if this is bothersome for them, but it drives me insane.<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this 4 stars based on the quality of ingredients, but I would not buy these because they're just not economical.  I don't want to spend $20+/week on dog treats (sorry, doggies!).

review/summary: Cats, raccoons, possums, and skunks turned it down - but the dog likes them
review/text: When I saw Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats in the Chicken flavor, I thought it would be a nice treat for my four indoor cats. I opened it up the very night the package arrived and gave one to each cat. They were interested in these treats at first, licking at them, sniffing them, and one cat even nibbled a little of it. That was the extent of their interest, however. All four treats were still laying on the floor 24 hours later. I've never seen these cats turn their nose up at a treat and they have never left one alone that long.<br /><br />I set cat food on the porch for some of the neighborhood strays, and along with those kitties I see raccoons, skunks, and possums visit my porch every night. I took the four treats my cats turned down and put them on the porch. The next day I found that not even the scavengers liked these treats.<br /><br />The package says these treats are for cats or dogs, so I took the rest of the package to work, where my boss brings his dog every day. CD (the dog) wasn't so sure about the first one, but took it anyway and ate it after looking at it for a bit. After that first one, she ate another right away when she got it and seems to enjoy them without hesitation now.<br /><br />I would say that these are probably not a good buy for your cats, based on my kitties' reactions, but your dog might give it a shot.

review/summary: healthy, happy snack
review/text: I wanted to really use the treats a few different times and such to make sure they didn't upset donny's stomach and be able to give a more detailed review. :) Thanks for sending me treats - Donny (and now Bella) love it. :)<br /><br />So for the Raw boost bites:<br />I really liked these treats because they were such a novelty and treat and my dog gobbled them up super fast. I think I they would better if they were smaller so that the dog doesn't swallow a huge disc of a treat. I really enjoyed knowing that I was giving my dog a really healthy treat every time and it wasn't going to add to his waistline too much. I think due to the large size of the treat and having a small dog I would see if there was a smaller treat size then I would buy them. They would be great for a larger dog though so you wouldn't have to worry about the large size of the treat.

review/summary: My dog LOVES them
review/text: I have a very very picky dog. It's pretty routine to pick out new treats that look like they should be delicious, but have them be completely snubbed once we get them home. I would honestly probably never have taken a risk on purchasing this treat (as opposed to getting a review sample for free) due to the price, because I'd have assumed there was such a slim chance my dog would agree to eat them. It turns out, though, that she thinks they're fantastic. She gets the same slightly crazed look when you offer her these that she gets for a chunk of hamburger.<br /><br />They suggest that you can crumble them over kibble to make it more appealing, but that bit didn't seem to have much effect on her. Still, she really likes them far more than just about any other treat product I've ever offered her, so I'm impressed. I'm doubly impressed that the list of ingredients involved looks so healthy and that this is basically food rather than treats, even if the dog thinks otherwise.<br /><br />You definitely have to make your own call on how much you're comfortable spending. These aren't exactly going to be a weekly purchase for me, but I fully expect that I'll be buying her a box periodically so that I can have them on hand for when I want something special to give her that's safer to carry around with me than hunks of roast chicken.

review/summary: Cardboard Yummies!
review/text: It's funny because these treats look and smell just like old musty cardboard, but the dogs just adore them. They line right up for them and twice I've had to reprimand them for stealing them right out of my hand when I was trying to give one to the dog next to them. They come in a sealed bag inside the outer paper back which can be re-sealed for freshness. Which didn't really matter much to me because these only lasted a week between my three greedy pups.

review/summary: Cats and Dogs Both Liked Them
review/text: Several reviewers have downgraded these treats because their cats didn't like them.  While I don't doubt this at all, cats being infamous for being finicky, both of my cats like them.  They are large enough that I can break off small bits for the two cats, then break the remainder in half for my two dogs.<br /><br />These would make nice training treats.  They are easily broken into small pieces, are very lightweight, and have very little smell (and what they do have is not objectionable).  They are made from, to quote the package, "minimally processed freeze dried raw ingredients."  They contain no grain.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends feeding these as a "boost" to a pet's diet, 1-2 Boost Bites per day per 20 pounds of the pet's body weight.  If I actually fed them this way, they would cost me several times more than my dogs' actual food costs, and I don't feed them cheap food.  It's hard to imagine anyone who would want to budget these into their pet's diet as anything more than an occasional treat.

review/text: I received a box of these and was afraid that they would be hard and I would have to break them up for my cat. Yes, my cat, although the description states dog, the box says for dogs and cats. Anyway, my cat is finicky and usually only enjoys treats that have seafood ingredients. First, the bites was soft, so I didn't have to break it up and second, my cat ate the chicken flavored boost like there was no tomorrow. So I have to say that this is a wonderful treat and good to know that it is healthy and pure.

review/summary: Great Taste and Great Ingredients
review/text: I am a big fan of these treats, which I was given a sample to try. First, they were very easy to break into smaller pieces, in comparison to some other freeze dried treats I've bought like freeze-dried liver. This is important as I like to use treats for training and need to break them into much smaller pieces than most treats are sold. I also will break them up to use inside puzzle toys like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZ8FWE">Nina Ottosson  Tornado </a>. The ingredients are excellent, and being freeze-dried, have a good shelf life compared to some soft treats. Also important to me is they are made in the USA. I'm refusing to buy treats made in China as many dog treats are. Just too many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Most important of course is whether my dog likes them. Now, my dog is not very picky, but he definitely reacts with more enthusiasm in training according to how much he likes the treat being used. And boy, does he LOVE these! He was sniffing around the shipping box even before I opened it which isn't something he typically does. Chicken is definitely high on his list of favorite foods, and these seem to have a very desirable smell and taste for my dog. I will definitely put them on my list to buy again.

review/summary: Of course the dogs loved them.
review/text: Raw boost Bites are a great pet snack.  I have three dogs, a Rottie, a Lab and a Basset Hound.  They all love their treats and went crazy over these snacks.  They are soft and easily breakable.<br /><br />5 Stars for taste.  Although I didn't taste them, I can tell when my dogs REALLY love something.<br /><br />5 Stars for ingredients as the first 4 ingredients are chicken and turkey products.<br /><br />3 Stars for value.  They are more expensive than the dog treats I usually buy for my dogs, and when you have three the quantity in the box just doesn't last that long.<br /><br />You will love this product if you want to give your dogs a more organic natural treat and are willing to pay for the naturalness.  They would also make great training tools, and are easily breakable for smaller dogs.

review/text: I broke each 'cookie' into many little bites, as soon as I did, they quickly devoured them.  I do have to say these are very filling, so expect to feed about 1/2 cookie per cat before they walk away.  Health wise, dried chicken is best for your cat or dog.  Cats especially need to be fed muscle meat, and these treats fit the bill.

review/summary: Very nutritious and convenient
review/text: I was really happy to have these Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried chicken treats when my dog wasn't feeling well and wasn't eating a lot of food.  I broke them into little pieces and gave them to her as a snack.  She likes stuff like this much better when she thinks it is a treat, rather than presenting it as a meal.  I have purchased other Nature's Variety products quite often in the past, but this is my first time getting the freeze dried treats.  I like that meat, fruit, and vegetables are the main ingredients and feel confident in feeding this to my dog.  The only reason I removed a star from the rating is because of the price.  It is quite expensive for the amount offered.  I will probably continue to buy another brand (Stella & Chewy's) freeze dried options because the price, while still high, is much better for the amount of product and my dog seems to like them both the same.

review/summary: The Cats Vote With Their Feet
review/text: The Boost Bites include what appear to be good ingredients: chicken, turkey, and vegetables.  What cat would not like this for a treat?<br /><br />My taste-test focus group consists of four cats.  They range in age from one to eighteen, in weight from eight to thirteen pounds, and include both genders.<br /><br />To test the treats on the focus group, I broke the Bites into cat-size pieces and offered the pieces to the felines on two consecutive days.  On the first try, two of the group ate their pieces, one licked at it but did not eat it, and the fourth cat walked away.<br /><br />I tried again on the second day.  This time, none of them would eat it; they all walked away.<br /><br />Clearly, the Boost Bites may be ok for dogs, but hold little interest for cats.  I suggest that the Bites be sold as dog treats, but not for cats.

review/summary: My dog loves them
review/text: My dog loves these treats.  She is not very discerning when it comes to treats.  She'll eat almost anything.  I try to be discerning in the foods I feed her though.  Looking at the ingredient list, nothing jumps out at me as problematic.  I'm not a vet, so I can't evaluate the ingredients scientifically, but they appear good to me. The treats consist of about 40% protein and 34% fat with other ingredient types including fiber and moisture.  The treats are freeze dried, so they feel dry to the touch and can easily be broken in pieces (although, expect some crumbling as they are soft).  The only ingredient I didn't recognize on the label is "montmorillonite clay."  After some internet sleuthing, it appears to be a natural anti-caking agent.<br /><br />Overall, my dog loves these treats and although I'm not a vet, none of the ingredients strikes me as unhealthy.  I feel comfortable feeding these to my dog.

review/summary: Dog and cat tested; 6 out of 6 give it 4 paws up!
review/text: WOW, what more can I say but A++++ from ALL my pets.  I tried Raw Boost Bites, a freeze dried treat; the chicken Formula.  I loved the ingredients.  Almost all real items I understand and would eat myself (if I wanted to eat that healthy).  The inside package has a zip top to keep the bites fresh.  Each treat is a round "disk" of dried ingredients, a little larger than a cracker and thicker.  There is very little if any smell to them, and they are dry to the touch.  I broke one Boost Bite into 4ths and gave some to each dog to try. The box says 1 Boost Bite per day per 20 pounds of body weight.  I have a 40 pound, a 20 pound, and a 12 pound dog.  Each gobbled it up immediately and looked for more.  I had one piece left and the cat was looking at me I offered it to him and he gobbled it up.  Then I re-inspected the front of the box.  It says it's for dogs AND cats!  I have 3 cats.  One cat will eat anything, but the other two are finicky.  There was no turning down the Boost Bites.  They all loved it.  If you have a finicky cat and are looking for a healthy treat, this has got to be your next purchase.  I was amazed at how much they enjoyed them.  Dog and cat tested.  6 out of 6 give it 4 paws up!

review/summary: Wonderful, nutritious, dog loves it.
review/text: These are great treats.  The dog loves them and is willing to perform for them, but if you read the list of ingredients, these are so nutritious!  My dog hates fruits and veggies, but she likes these even though they contain some veggies.  Good way to get your dog to eat her veggies.<br /><br />The only thing kind of gross is the crumbly texture.  These feel like particle board or something, and they fall apart.  Dog doesn't care about that, but it was kind of tricky to carry them around to use as treats.  There was little disintegrated bits in the bottom of the bag which I dumped on her dog food.

review/summary: Not for Cats
review/text: I have 3 cats with 3 different personalities. None of them were impressed with these treats at all. I gave each one of them a fourth of a treat as I have small cats and the treats are rather large. All three were interested as I was getting the packaging open. Two of the cats tried to eat the treat, but they were not able to chew it. One gave up after just a little bit and the other gave it a pretty good effort and even came back to try again a minute later. Then I decided to take another treat and crumble it up really good. I laid it out for them. One cat actually ate a few pieces, but that was it. The second cat didn't even come over to try and the third actually tried to bury it.

review/summary: My Dog Liked/My Cat Did Not
review/text: I got these thinking they were cat treats, but I guess they are for both dogs and cats, which is a good thing, because my cat did not like them at all.<br /><br />They are kind of big for a cat, so I broke it up into smaller pieces, but my cat just took a few sniffs and walked passed it. So then I gave one to my dog. If he loves something, he will eat it immediately, barely taking time to chew it. If he does not like something he will go bury it and never bother eating it. If it's questionable, he plays with it for a few minutes, then either eats it or buries it. For this treat, he played with it for a few minutes. He did his little puppy dance, bum up in the air, then poking his head at the treat a few times. Totally funny to watch. Then he decided to eat it. So I'd say it's not his favorite, but he decided they aren't bad.

review/summary: My cat doesn't like it
review/text: It indicates on the package as well as on the product page at the Nature's Variety site that this product is for dogs and cats. My cat does not of course speak for all cats, but my cat does not like this product. She sniffed the piece I offered her, then licked it, then walked away. I broke a small piece off and put it in a clean dish in case she might try it later. (I'd rate my cat a 5 on a finicky scale of 1-10.)<br /><br />Later when I was in the kitchen, I saw her go to the dish and take a nibble of the product. Within seconds she started to retch (something she rarely does).<br /><br />Based on this I would say don't buy this product unless and until you've had a chance to discover if your cat or cats will actually eat it.

ALL of my Burmese love them, so do both Siamese!<br />Since our new kitten seems to prefer only dry food, I use these treats (broken up) as an extra boost for his diet. As an added bonus, they already have the consistency of horked-up dried cat puke, yum!

review/summary: my dogs loves them
review/text: These are natural, healthy, freeze dried treats that are about the size of a half dollar and a half-inch thick. They're a little too big to fit in a Kong or the rubber mesh ball I put treats in for my dog so I give her these treats as a reward. The texture is just what you'd expect from something that is freeze-dried and they're quite crumbly so they will make a mess on the floor. Fortunately, my dog is such a hog that she wolfs up every last crumb. Obviously she loves the flavor but my dog isn't picky so I would be shocked if she didn't like these. I would buy these again although probably not very often due to the slightly high price which is  a little higher than what  I usually pay for treats. I most often get the Mother Nature biscuits made by Natura. I gave these treats four stars due to the price and the size being too big. The ingredients are as follows: Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.

review/summary: Huge hit with cats and dogs.
review/text: Freeze Dried Treats were a huge hit in my house!  My dog absolutely loved them, and she's a dog who isn't all that into food.  I especially like that since they are dry you can stuff them in a kong without getting the kong stuck with nasty food you can't clean out.  So, great kong treats.  They are also sized perfectly to fit in a large size kong (but easily broken apart into smaller pieces).  My cat also wolfed them down with delight and begged for more.  Being raw they should have many more nutrients than most commercial treats.

review/summary: I wasn't impressed...
review/text: Okay, first of all, this says for dogs AND cats, and I sampled it because it actually only said "cat treats."  Ummm, I have three cats, and none of them would touch this stuff.  First of all, they're HUGE, round discs.  You have to break it up into about 30 pieces (which is soft and gross and makes your hands stink) and even then, none of my cats were at all enthused with the results.  They sniffed, turned their nose up, and walked away.<br /><br />The dog however, was happy to clean up behind them.  She loved these treats, and they're definitely more large-dog size.  Each treat is a couple inches in diameter, almost an inch thick, I have NO IDEA why they would label these as cat treats.<br /><br />They're a little expensive for what they are, and there aren't that many in the package.  However the ingredients are good, and my dog loved them.  I'm just pretty disappointed these weren't cat treats since that's what I had originally wanted.<br /><br />Good for dogs, find something else if you have a cat!

review/text: My dogs LOVE these and so has every foster dog that we have given it to.  These are a treat not a replacement for a meal.  They are full of great ingredients and none of the bad stuff.  They have a high protein and fat content but you shouldn't be giving your dogs 10 a day.  Honestly, we have dogs that range from 35-60 pounds and they only get a 1/2 a cookie at a time.  My husband is a veterinarian and he was impressed by the quality of the ingredients.  They are a great treat and we will definitely buy again.

review/summary: My cat went nuts for these things.
review/text: My male cat isn't too into treats. We even got some plain freeze-dried chicken chunks recently and he was excited but not freakout-excited like my other cat gets.<br /><br />But as soon as he got a whiff of this, he went from disinterested in treat time to holy-moly-let-me-climb-your-leg-give-it-to-me-now excited. He ran in circles trying to anticipate where I'd put it down!<br /><br />The pucks are kind of huge for cats - 1.75" diameter - but they're a soft puck made of freeze-dried powdery foods, so it's easy for them to nibble and fuss with it until it's gone. It takes them about a minute to fully finish their pucks, even with ravenous chomping.<br /><br />It has natural ingredients, but it's not all meat, so there are veggies in there as well. Is that good? I don't know. Most "primal" foods do have some vegetation in there as well, so it seems standard for this type of pet food line.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is that the pucks are powdery enough that they make a crumbly mark where they are set down, so if I treat the cats on my carpet or couch, there's powder left over that they can't get at without licking it up. Other than that, this is a winner. We are rotating between this treat and the freeze-dried chicken breast treat, and one cat prefers these and one cat prefers the other, so overall, I definitely like this product and plan to buy more when my initial package runs out.

review/summary: Portioned better for dogs than cats: ingredient list is healthy & natural!
review/text: These Raw Boost Bites from Nature's Variety Instinct line are about the size of very thick ginger-snap with a recommended feeding amount of 1 to 2 biscuits a day.  High in quality protein and mixed with a vairety of wholesome vegetales, fruits and natural heart-heathy oils, I wouldn't hesitate to feed one of these a day to my dog.  However, even though my cats love them, I only allow them a quater of a crumbled biscuit a couple times a week.  Although ground chicken bone is 1 of the lesser ingredients, you do not find "bone meal" or any other waste product such as "brewers rice" orother nutritionally depeleted fillers.  Just plenty or good dark greens, carrots, apples and butternut squash to help make  a biscuit out of the Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver and Turkey Heart that form the protein base of this healthy treat.  There is a small amount of honey in the product as well.  The ingredients list is one of the best I've seen on a commercially available pet product in a long time.<br /><br />Both my cats and my dog anjoyed the treats a little too much so I have to hide them behind a locked cabinet door!  My favorite aspect of this treat is the lack of dyes and the fact that they aren't rock hard.  They are easy to divide into sensible servings for the cats and probably better for them than their own dry food even though I use a high quality dry food for the cats and feed mostly a meat diet to the dogs.  This is a "raw" product, which means the ingredients where not cooked above a certain temperature.  The product was then freeze-dried to presevre freshness.  As long as you keep the bag well-sealed and out of direct heat & sunlight, you shouldn't have any problems with spoilage.<br /><br />They recommend 1 to 2 bites per day per 20 Lbs of body weight and to asjust for your feeding accordingly.  Obviously that means subtracting a little if you plan to use these as a daily supplement.  Again, with the cats, I cut the disk in half and then crumbled half of that into pieces and used it as a training reward.  If you arent' sure what the correct amount is for your pet, you should talk to your vet, call the company or err on the side of offering less rather than more.  Overfeeding even a well-formulated food can lead to obesity, especially if your pets love these Boost Bites as much as mine did.

review/summary: Just average
review/text: I have two Norwegian Elkhounds, one 6 years old and one 6 months old, and a 10 year old cocker spaniel. I am always looking for new treats to use as rewards for them. So, I took up the chance to give these a try.<br /><br />First thing I noticed, is that these treats come in a almost "health food/gourmet" type bag leading one to believe that they are an all natural healthy treat. After reading the ingredients they are just like most other treats on the market. There is absolutely nothing special about them. That's ok, dogs like treats.<br /><br />Second the individual treats are fairly large. Even my adult Elkhound who is 50 pounds, I would never give her a full sized treat from this bag. For the ingredients they are just too big.<br /><br />Third, the packaging is made to make it look like the box is plumb full of treats. When in actuality there are not that many treats in the bag at all. But, keep in mind that each treat should realistically be broken up into 3-4 pieces at a minimum.<br /><br />Did the dogs like them? Sure they did, there was no messy "side effects" after digestion so that's always a plus. But, at the end of the day the size of the treats, how few there really are, and the ingredients just make this a very average treat. Nothing special here.

review/summary: So So As Far As Treats Go
review/text: First of all I used the bites as a treat and not as a substitute for their normal kibble.  I have two dogs one 20 pds and one 30 pds and each dog gets two treats a day.  I typically buy my treats from 3 Dog Bakery or some other high end dog store and over time feel like I know what my dogs like.  As far as giving the bites as a treat they are way too fatty and high in protein to give a whole size bite as a treat (these were designed to be a subsitute for kibble) so I broke them in half and gave one to each dog.  They ate them and continued to eat them daily until I ran out.  However my dogs go crazy for certain treats and will take a treat to a safe place and if a treat is really good the bigger dog will try and get the crumbs from the smaller dog.  WIth the Nature Variety the dogs merely took the treat and ate it on the spot.  They did not search out crumbs and did not seem to be overly excited for this treat as others I have given them in the past.<br /><br />Once again this was meant to subsitute kibble but in my opinion it would get expensive quickly so I used my sample bag for treats.

review/summary: This is not an ordinary meat treat for pets.
review/text: These treats are definitely different.  They are practically weightless, and have an odd texture like a cross between a packing peanut and paperboard, with a dusty exterior.  For some reason, I keep thinking of a rice cake or a meringue cookie when I look at these.  This is not necessarily bad, it is just different.<br /><br />My schnauzer was more hesitant with this treat, I think it was due largly to the texture, as she is used to hard, crunchy stuff.  She took one big chomp and it crumbled, ending up as a pile of small pieces at her feet that she ate carefully, one or two at a time, until it was finished.<br /><br />The smell of these treats is appealing to me, actually.  We have the chicken variety.  Unlike some meat treats that seem to radiate with a salty, bouillion-cube-like scent, these have a subtle chicken soup-like fragrance.<br /><br />The package contains 4 oz., which works out to about 16 treats.  This is pricey compared to, say, Milkbones, but as a human who is willing to spend more for quality ingredients, I wouldn't call the cost outrageous, especially since I don't give these to my dog daily.<br /><br />I prefer treats that work my dog's instincts to gnaw and chew, and if her teeth get a bit of cleaning at the same time then I'm happy.  The Raw Boost Bites don't give her any of that.  However, as an occasional treat to give her something interesting and different, these are a fairly good option.

review/summary: Dogs went wild for it, cat not so much
review/text: I tested this product out on two dogs and a cat. Daisy, my neighbor's border collie, went "absolutely ape" for it, in the words of her owner. I saw this myself; the dog would "walk" for twenty feet if you held the treat up just out of her reach and started walking away. My girlfriend's dachshund Monkey had a similar reaction. Monkey would snatch up the treat and run into the next room away from everyone else, and scarf it down in the corner. The treats were a bit large for her to swallow whole (about the size of Kennedy half-dollars and about half an inch thick), so I started breaking them up for her so she wouldn't choke in her enthusiasm.<br /><br />Speaking of breaking them up, they become very crumbly, so make sure you either break them over the counter or be prepared to sweep.<br /><br />The crumbs actually worked to my advantage with my girlfriend's cat Cleo. She would not eat the treat by itself, even when broken up. However, when I broke it up in her food, she ate it, though she gave no indication that it was any different from her normal food.<br /><br />The Raw Boost Bites package get bonus points for being irresistible to canines and having healthy ingredients. Since it's advertised as a cat treat as well, I can't give it five stars since Cleo was apathetic toward it, but I know what I'm buying the dogs from now on.

Regular Stella & Chewy's are a bit too large for most toys. Secondly, the Raw Bites are a touch harder, therefore less flaky and crumbly than Stella & Chewys. This results in less mess!<br /><br />Overall a great treat and product, just a little pricey (as with all raw, grain-free freeze-dried dog food).

review/summary: Instinct Raw Boost Bites are a good tool for obedience and behavior training of dogs!
review/text: The Raw Boost Bites are � inch thick discs that are about 1-1/2 inch in diameter.  Some treats on the market today range from hard to soft and chewy.  I would classify these treats as somewhere between those two ranges.  The bites have an appearance and texture of a � inch cardboard disc that was easily broken up into smaller pieces.  Of particular interest to us was the ingredients of the treat and we were happy to see that all the ingredients (other than the preservatives) were natural food products.  An added bonus for us was the fact that this treat is made in the USA.<br /><br />In our house, we do "controlled" feeding; meaning that each dog is given a portioned amount of dog food at the same time twice a day.  This is in direct opposition to "free" feeding (having food available at all times throughout the day).  They are all fed in their crated kennel.  Our cats are free fed; with the food on a perch out of the reach of the dogs.<br /><br />A total of 8 dogs and 2 cats were tested for this review.  Five of the dogs and both cats are ours and 3 of the dogs were visiting at the time this testing took place.  The breed of dogs tested were 3 Welsh Pembroke Corgi's, 2 Border Collie adults, 1 Belgian Sheep dog, 1 Border Collie mix puppy and 1 Golden Retriever.  Four dogs are female and four dogs are male.  Six of the dogs are highly food driven, one is somewhat picky of what it eats and the last dog is very picky of what it eats.  The cats are of no particular breed and both are female.  All dogs tested were fed 2 hours prior to testing.<br /><br />We wanted a controlled testing environment whereby each dog was given the opportunity to visit a small bowl of 1 Raw Boost Bite that was broken up into smaller pieces than the original.  Each dog, one at a time and alone, was taken out of their crated kennels and let loose inside of the house.  Each dog easily found the treat.  The 3 Corgi's, the Border Collie puppy mix, 1 of the Border Collies adults, and the Golden Retriever (a total of 6 of the 8 dogs) immediately feasted on the treat and thoroughly enjoyed the treat.  All of these dogs are highly food driven.<br /><br />The other Border Collie adult sniffed the treat, went away for about 30 seconds and returned to the treat bowl and ate each piece but not nearly as vigorously as the other 6 dogs.  This dog is pretty "picky" of what it eats and is not food driven at all.  The Belgian Sheepdog is very picky of what it eats and after one sniff, refused to even try the treat.<br /><br />My two cats live a relaxed life style of sitting on the couch and since they are not trained will only eat soft food.  They both took one look at Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Chicken flavor and walked away.<br /><br />In conclusion, we were pleased with this product.  Boost Bites do not get a perfect rating because one of my dogs and the cats did not want to eat them.  After the response most of the dogs had to this product, I will be ordering these again for them to act as an obedience training tool.

review/summary: Awesome but pricey; however best pet 'treat' ever
review/text: If you get these (and I do highly recommend them) you will look at them and think is this sand paper? They are freeze dried so they have an odd consistency. But your pets saliva quickly solves that. They must smell great, for our cats at least they LOVE them. Love them. They like other treats but I have never seen them like any treat more.<br /><br />I take one 'biscuit' and break it in half. I then break each half in half. I serve 2 quarters to one cat and the other 2 to the other. They gulp them down. And the ingriedient list is spectacular. So good I have been tempted to try them. The highest weight ingridients are chicken, turkey, turkey live, turked heart, pumpkinseeds....Then a bunch of other mostly vegetables. Crude protien is minimum of 40%.<br /><br />I feel great about giving these treats to my cats. By far the healtiest treats we have ever given them. They also come in a nice package with a resealable inner plastic bag. I would highly recommend these for cats and small dogs. Medium and big dogs this can be an expensive product. also a bonus made by a small US independent pet food company. I was lucky enough to get to try these but I will also quite likely buy them. I just feel very good about getting high quality 'real food' into our pets' diets.

review/summary: Finally a dog treat that our dog actually likes
review/text: We've tried a number of different types of treats for our dog, who has remained steadfastly indifferent to most of them.  She has generally preferred table scraps as treats instead of treats marketed for dogs.  However, when this package arrived and we opened it, she immediately responded.  Just the smell was sufficient to get her excited, and she clearly enjoyed the treats when we gave them to her.  The enthusiasm she displayed was pretty much the best endorsement I could ask for.<br /><br />Because the package indicated that these treats were intended for both dogs and cats, we also offered some to our cat.  Here the reaction was must more indifferent.  While the smell seemed to interest him, he never actually ate the treat.  So I don't know that these are necessarily the best treat for a cat, but they are certainly dog-tested and approved.

review/summary: Not good for cats - too hard to eat
review/text: With all due respect to Amazon reviewer "Book and Dog Lover", I can't imagine any cat would enjoy these treats.  Because they're freeze-dried, they are too hard for a cat to chew without an incredible amount of effort.  Even as I held the treat in my fingers, my poor cat could not bite off a chunk.  Are we supposed to add water? I don't know because there are no feeding instructions on the packaging.  I attempted to add some water it didn't reconstitute anything.  The treats remained hard as rocks.  Breaking up the piece into smaller chunks didn't seem to make a difference either.  Plus, the addition of water suddenly made the treats unappealing to my cat.  Apparently all she liked was smelling and licking the sticky powder coating around the treat.

review/summary: Both Our Cats Loved These Treats
review/text: I love this company so was excited to try these new treats. Both our cats are 2 years old. These remind me of little hockey pucks. Easy to cut or break up. Each treat has 20 - 23 calories so I want to make sure to count that in with the calories they are getting for the day. I gave them each 1/4 of a chicken treat and they grabbed it off the plate to eat it. They loved it!  When I was getting ready to give them 1/4 more they were meowing for more and then purred while they were eating it. They were very happy. And so was I. These treats are  healthy for them  and that is important to me.

review/summary: the cat wouldn't eat it
review/text: I was excited to get some new treats for my cat. When I had the package in front of her she was rubbing all aganist it so I was hoping she would like them. I gave one to her whole at first and she ignored it. I thought the treat may be too big for her since they were a bit bigger than silver dollars so I broke it up and put it in her food dish with some of her food. She basically ate all her food but ignored the pieces of the treat.<br /><br />I do like that there is nothing artificial in these treats. The box states that what is contained in the treats include: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove. However, even if it is all natural, if the cat won't eat it, it does me no good.<br /><br />I know all cats and dogs are different so some will like the treats. However for me, I will not be buying these in the future.

review/summary: My Finicky, Older Cat Licks the Bowl Clean When I Give Her This
review/text: This is the first treat I've gotten that says it is for both cats and dogs, so I was a little skeptical at first that my cat, Lily, would like it. She's 15 years old and has become very finicky about what she eats. She now turns up her nose at our Purina dry food, which used to be her favorite. I've been feeding her cans of salmon and gravy (Fancy Feast) but even with that she leaves a lot of leftover salmon pieces in the bowl (!)<br /><br />Discouraged, I had nothing to lose and decided to give her half of a Raw Boost treat to see if she'd like it. The box says you should give your cat only one or 2 treats per 20lbs of the cat's weight. Well, my Lily is a tiny cat and weighs only 5 lbs or so, so imagine my dilemma. Taking the treat out of the package, I was amused at how much the treat resembles a peanut butter cookie. It's soft, however, and easy to tear in half. It feels crumby like a cookie, however, so I decided to break it down into little "crumbs" for Lily to eat. She has problems with digestion and throws up more than the typical cat, so I'm always careful to chop up her food into small, bite-sized pieces.<br /><br />Imagine my relief that Lily loves it! She licked her dish clean and begged for more. I'm going to make a note to buy more.

review/summary: My dog LOVES them
review/text: The facts about my dog:<br />A rescue, now 14 years old (adopted at 6 months), a poodle mix with, probably Bichon, maybe terrier, going deaf, eyesight getting worse but still okay, olfactory faculties still very strong (far as I know).<br />A picky eater with regard to both meals and treats.<br />But she loves these.  They are easy for her to eat, don't stink up human hands when doled out, and there's a resealable bag that really works the way it is supposed to.<br />Back to the dog and her love of the treats:  we give her a half at a time (she's about 12 lbs) and no more than one per day.  They are her favorites at this point and we will purchase these when our Vine allotment is done.

review/summary: My four cats would not eat this
review/text: My four cats liked the smell of these treats but they would not eat them.<br /><br />The treat to human eyes is totally unappealing. Not only are they freeze-dried raw but they look hairy (similar to a dust bunny I would find under the bed). In size, they are the circumference and height of a double-stuffed Oreo cookie. They are also very light and as easy to break up as a wafer.<br /><br />I broke several into smaller bite-sized pieces and left them out overnight.  One of my cats looked like he was going to take a bite but eventually walked away. The other three smelled the pieces and left without even trying them.<br /><br />The box of the Chicken Formula Raw Boost Bites claims these treats are for cats and dogs and are made of chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, etc.  Each large piece is 23 calories and they recommend 1 to 2 pieces per 20 pounds of body weight.  However, since my four cats won't eat them, I'm going to throw out all this goodness to the wildlife.  Maybe some critter will eat it.

review/summary: My dog **LOVED** them!
review/text: I used to feed my pets a raw diet (now I feed Blue Buffalo Wilderness formula) so I was pleasantly surprised to see a commercial product even MENTIONING raw feeding on the label. The fact that it's made here in the USA is another huge plus in its favor.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure what to make of these, they look....weird. Like space food or something. My dog heard the package rustling though and immediately ran over to see what I had. When I held a piece out to her she was reluctant; she sniffed it thoroughly and acted like she wasn't going to eat it. No surprise there, she likes very few treats. I haven't had much luck testing out pet products on her, as she is so picky. (You wouldn't think a mutt who ate trash for months as a stray would be this picky but she is) She decided though that she wanted this treat: she snapped it out of my hand and ran behind the couch to eat it, so that no one could even *think* of taking it from her. Normally she just takes her favorite treat a few feet away from me, so the fact that she ran and hid to eat this means a lot.<br /><br />My elderly (15 year old) cat even showed an interest in these, which is not normal for her in the least. I haven't seen her accept a treat in YEARS.<br /><br />My pets' enthusiasm for this treat puts it on my recommend and buy list!

review/summary: Most of My Furry Children Liked Them, But Not All of Them
review/text: I have six cats an am constantly trying different treats. I try to make sure that they get the healthiest of all foods but this is not always an option. Most treats on the market are glorified potato chips for cats.<br /><br />The first think I noticed is these treats smell. Not horribly, but you can tell there is real food in them. They are a 1 � in circular biscuit. The perfect size for a dog, but I have to break it into six pieces for my cats. When breaking the biscuit up, it tends to crumble.<br /><br />Of the five cats that eat treats, four were right there begging for them. When I put the treat pieces down one wolfed it down right away, two sniffed them thoroughly then ate them, and the fourth walked away without eating it. I gave another piece to the fifth cat. After sniffing it, he ate the treat. I tried a second time and the same cat refused to eat the treat but the other three wolfed theirs down and tried to fight over the one that was left on the floor. They seem to be a big hit among the furry children.<br /><br />The first thing that I'm concerned about is the universal cat/dog treat. I was always under the impression that there is a reason why we have both cat and dog food. Both animals have different nutritional needs so they need to be fed separate foods. I'm a little leery of a product that is advertising as a meal for both animals.<br /><br />The Amazon Product page advertises these as a meal, treat, or food topper. The Nature's Variety website says that these are specifically treats. Please make sure you don't feed these as food. Also, make sure to adjust the food so you are not feeding too many calories to your pet.<br /><br />Finally, the box is huge, but the bag inside is small. It looks like there are only 16 biscuits in the bag. Having that in mind, you are paying almost eleven dollars (as of 8/3/12) for a box. To me, that is way too much to spend on treats.<br /><br />Over all, I do think they are a good treat for pets. There are a lot of healthy ingredients and are a big hit at my house. Honestly I will not be buying these anytime because of the cost of them.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Not Suitable For Cats
review/text: I selected these to feed to my cats.  Because amazon didn't list the ingredients I had little to go on.  I was under the impression that these were 100% freeze dried "raw" chicken & turkey treats.  When the pkg. arrived I was disappointed to see that there are a heck of a lot of other ingredients.  Seems a high price to pay for a 4 ounce package of "treats" that don't have ingredients much different from top quality foods such as Wellness, Before Grain & others.  (Ingredient list is at the bottom of this review if you are looking for that info.)<br /><br />These "bites" are only bite sized for medium to large dogs.  For my cats they are WAY too big.  I had to break them into at least 4 - 6 pcs. in order for the cats to be able to eat them.  Even with my breaking them up, the cats still had to work at them.  Their freeze dried condition creates a very airy & light biscuit that is spongy, not crunchy.  It seemed to stick to the cats teeth making it very difficult for them to eat.<br /><br />The cats will ONLY eat these if they are very very hungry.  If I put down anything else, they will ignore the Boost Bites.  I also have barn cats that hunt pretty much everything so I feed them a cheap cat food.  I know they are getting tons of healthy nutrition in all the rodents, insects, birds, amphibians & grasses they can get their little paws on.  However they do enjoy their junk kibble.  Seeing how these Raw Boost Bites were an epic fail for the indoor cats, I tried it on the barn cats.  They were a tad more enthusiastic although they appreciated having the biscuits broken into bits too despite their bone crunching swallowing rodents whole abilities.  They struggled with the bites just as much as the indoor kitties.<br /><br />The bites seem more suitable for a dog.  Dogs aren't known to do a lot of chewing & are not usually as fussy as a cat.  I doubt a spongy dry biscuit would matter to an animal that tends to wolf things down within a gulp or two.<br /><br />Even though this is a product I'm not likely to buy in the future, I do not feel it deserves less than 3 stars when I think of all the disgusting garbage that is on store shelves for us to buy & poison our pets with.<br /><br />Ingredients as per the box:<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkin seeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flax seeds, Montomrillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols (note: probable GMO ingredient)with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin (note: this is being promoted as a prebiotic for fiber & digestive health.  There is evidence that inulin may not be safe for the digestive system.  It's safety is questionable.  I avoid it.), Sage, Clove.

review/summary: Maggie Sez "More!"
review/text: Maggie went nuts over these Instinct Raw Boost Bites, and she is a very finicky cat. Liddy was mildly interested, with a nibble here and a nibble there, and Frankie is just peculiar; she will only eat her dull kibble food. The list of ingredients on the box of these freeze dried treats looks mighty fine, with everything from chicken to ground flaxseeds and broccoli. Each treat is a 1 � inch round, with the slight consistency and look of a shortbread cookie, and has a fairly decent smell for the human nose. You can easily break them into 4 or more pieces for your cat.<br /><br />These round treats are for both dogs and cats, and are estimated as 1 or 2 for every 20 lbs. of weight. At the rate Maggie would like to eat these, she'd have to let out the buttons in her fur jacket. It's nice though that I've found something she likes, and that it's such a healthy treat. Thank you Nature's Variety for making a treat made of good, natural food for our fussy fur friends. Packaging is good, with a clear resealable bag inside the cardboard display box.

review/summary: Two out of three cats say NO.
review/text: Was it the sound of the plastic bag or the smell? Anyway, two of my cats came running when I opened the package. These things are WAY too big for cats, so I broke off pieces for each of them. The girl ate a piece after much pawing, but would not eat a second small piece. The boy sniffed and sniffed and pawed and pawed, but wouldn't eat a bit, and both of them left. Then our third cat walked in, obviously intrigued by the smell. He ate the others' leftovers and looked around for more. So, I guess that's about a 33 percent acceptance rate.<br /><br />Besides being way too big for cats, these things look... weird is the nicest word I can think of. They look like hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes. They even have weird hair-like things sticking out of them.<br /><br />The ingredients include pumpkin seeds, apples, carrots, squash, flax seeds, broccoli, and more plant products. Cats eat meat. And I really have to wonder what function another ingredient, "Montmorillonite Clay" (a.k.a. Fullers Earth) serves.<br /><br />These are sized for a medium to large dog (following the directions, an average cat should get less than half a "cookie" per day--if they even want one), and it seems to me the ingredients are more suited for dogs as well...if you are OK with the clay.

review/summary: Weird
review/text: I don't really know what to make of these treats.  I was first drawn to them because of the claim they were for both cats and dogs and since it is something of an extra special treat it's nice to have something the whole family can enjoy.  But I was not impressed on any level.  Lets be honest, we all by these over priced pet treats for ourselves and not the pets.  If you honestly wanted to make your pet ecstatic you would go to the butcher shop, get tub of chicken livers or giblets, cook them up and have very happy pets.  For me this product is outrageously expensive, has an offensive smell and a texture of sawdust.<br /><br />The makers are trying to draw you in with this idea of it being "Raw" but do you want to feed a pet, or better yet even handle a product where the main ingredient is chicken if it actually is raw?  Though it doesn't say so on the package I don't think this item is actually freeze dried raw meat, but instead is supposed to appeal to the human's desire to feed their pet something that's healthy, i.e. raw diet for dogs.  But I see nothing in this item to make it any healthier than many other pet treats that are much cheaper in price.  I was also a little shocked at some of the health claims made on the package too.  Apparently, "Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidents of ear infections and healthier teeth & gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experienced."  I have to call B.S. on that claim.<br /><br />The only real positive thing I can say about this product is that on one cat loved it.  My dog and other cat ate it, but weren't crazy about it.<br /><br />2 stars.

Since cats are carnivores, this food fits the bill as it is mostly JUST fish, not fillers like corn and grains that really are not good for cats.<br />I really didn't like feeding the cat canned food because it grosses me out.  This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.

review/summary: Cats love the food (Hooray!) I hate packaging
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Slop.
review/text: Maybe my cat is spoiled. We've fed her "Soulistic" brand pouches since the day we brought her home. I saw this product when I last shopped for her food. It looked like a real gourmet scene, so lovely was the image of the food on the packaging. Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.

review/summary: The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)
review/text: I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Finally a food my finicky feline will finish!
review/text: My cat is 15 years old, and has NEVER liked a kitty treat in her life - the only non-dry cat food she would ever eat was REAL tuna fish juice, drained from the can (and never mind the tuna). She has also had what I affectionately call a "tender tummy", meaning that every few weeks, since she was a kitten, she has had vomiting episodes that last a day or so and then disappear again. No explanation. Basically, I've just had to find cat food for her that matches the carpet on the way back up. Ew.<br /><br />About a year ago, she stopped eating all together, and I was worried that she and I had reached the end of her long life. In actuality, she had just decided she no longer liked the IAMS senior she had eaten for 10 years, was going on a hunger strike that put her in the ER Vet with failing kidneys due to dehydration.<br /><br />Enter Wiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna (in the pack of ten, with the sardines and Whitefish/tuna mix). She instantly started eating again, and her health returned in a matter of days. AND, no more random vomiting!! She even deigns to eat dry cat food once a day to supplement the moist stuff - I'm using IAMS young adult (orange bag), and have had no problems there either.<br /><br />She has her preferences with the Wiskas, don't be deceived. She will ONLY eat the purrfectly fish, NOT any other flavor, and really doesn't prefer the sardines (neither do I). The tuna entree with the whitefish is often only halfway eaten, but the tuna entree alone is always finished, which is why I was so happy to see it for sale here by itself.<br /><br />One complaint, though. My kitchen now smells like dead fish. But, to save my carpets, her health, and my sanity, I'll sacrifice a little smell.

review/text: I divide a pack into 3 pieces about once a week for my cats. They are a bunch of American Shorthairs that wandered in from wherever cats come from and my wife started feeding them. Most of them are between 10-15 years old. They love this type of food, and come running when they get a whiff. It does smell good, and in a pinch, I might try it in a sandwich. Just kidding. Anyway, if you are looking for food for a finicky cat, this is the one.

review/summary: Whiskas Won
review/text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her "wet food" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a "normal" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices.

review/text: As my title says,my cats LOVED all of the gravy-they lapped it up before eating the pieces of chicken. However i am NOT a fan of these pouches-i think they are a mess to deal with and no matter how careful you are to keeping your kitchen counter neat-some of the gravy always ends up there.A tip after getting the food out of the pouch with a spoon--add some water to the pouch and swish it around and add it to the cats plate to make a little more gravy. I wouldn't buy this again unless it was on sale. That said my cats do LOVE the whiskas fish pouches-you just open up the pouches and the food just slides out-no spoon required.

review/text: While my cats love this food, I don't.  I gave it three stars for that reason.  My cats will eat this up in a heart beat but I absolutely abhor the packaging.  Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.

review/summary: Not Cheap, but Worth It!
review/text: While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!

review/summary: Purrfect!
review/text: A few years ago I bought a few packs of this at Walmart to give as a special morning treat for our 4 cats.  I would give them each a small spoonful and they were happy.  It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.  I tried some of the other 'flavors' and my cats let it be known they didn't like anything except this particular one.  They don't like any chunks of fish or whatever in their wet food.  In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.  I even haul 24 pouches in my carry on bag each trip back to Venezuela with me so my cat here can have her special morning treat.

review/text: My cats love the food. The food is formed in the shape of the pouch so I do chop it up with fork to make it easier for them. The food looks and smells like fish. They like the snapper the best. Not to much moisture that had one cat throw up. No more wasted food. They eat it all. I wish it came all snapper but they probably like variety.  Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.

Although we have dry food out all the time, the cats run to the kitchen every time we are in there hoping they will get a serving of Whiskas.

review/summary: Kittties Liked at first, Then Turned Up Nose
review/text: When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is "THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says "Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on "Subscibe and Save" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off "Subscribe and Save" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something "different" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better.

review/text: My cats are on a diet of super high quality dry food, but once a day I split up a pouch of Whiskas Purrfectly Fish or Chicken between them.<br /><br />They love it.  I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.

review/summary: My Cats go Ape S*** over this food. Great stuff!
review/text: But i wont be buying any more variety packs from Amazon anymore, as they raised the price by $10. Too bad. I can get it local for much cheaper now.<br /><br />Tip for the people who have problems with the packages. Grab the package firmly above tear line, shake the package back and forth a few times until all the food and juices get pushed down to the bottom. Then open, hardly ever have the "squirt" or "dribble" anymore, after giving it the shakes.

review/summary: My picky cats love Purrfectly Fish
review/text: Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.

review/summary: Great product for older cat
review/text: We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat.

review/summary: My cats LOVE all 3 of the chicken flavors
review/text: I have four cats who all love any flavor in the purrfectly chicken multipack.  I always leave dry food out for them and only feed them the wet food twice a day, before I go to work and as soon as I get home.  Whenever they smell the food them come running to me, purr, and rug against my leg.  It is super cute.<br /><br />Although I agree with previous reviews it is a little annoying to open.  I cut the pouch open, empty the food onto a shallow bowl, and then spoon the rest of it out (definitly worth it, there is always ALOT left within the pouch), I then add a pouch full of water.<br /><br />Adding the water seemed to really help alot.  Adding the water made the wet cat food smell much less noticeable and helped to get the last pieces of chicken out of the pouch ( I add a tiny bit of water and shake it really good). My vet stressed that my cats needed to drink more water he was the one who suggested adding the water.

review/summary: Four Paws up
review/text: I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on.

review/summary: Passes all the tests
review/text: This shelter kitty had tried it all but since being fed Whiskas Purrfectly chicken he won't consider anything else.  He prepares to eat if I offer somthing else but stops short of the bowl like he's sniffing his food and turns his head and walks away.  He won't eat any other of this brands products nor any other brand no matter how expensive. The pouch is not convenient but the fact that I know he will eat and enjoy his food makes up for it.

review/summary: Only wet food my kitties eat - and only chicken
review/text: After trying numerous brands of cat food, I finally found that this and only this brand, and it must be chicken, is what my kitties like.  They particularly like the white meat, the brown pellets are left after juice and white meat are gone.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Cats seem to prefer this brand
review/text: My 4 cats seem to prefer the "Whiskas Purrfectly" brand to any other wet food I've tried.  These fish flavors are not sliced; there are big blocks of pate in each sack that I have to break up with a knife so they can eat it.  My cats like this flavor set for a change, but really like the same brand in "Chicken" flavor, which is sliced.  If you have trouble with it splashing when you unzip each sack, try keeping a pair of scissors by your cat food area and cutting the bags; it's less messy and you can get more of the food into the cat bowl.

review/summary: great cat food
review/text: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish is a good quality food and our cat seems to really like it.  It is mostly fish with very little grain filler.  This is healthier for a cat as they are carnivores.  Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.

review/summary: Not the best for your cat's long term health
review/text: I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 "magical" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.

review/summary: Our cats threw up in pain after eating this food
review/text: We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it. Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.

review/summary: Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better
review/text: Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.  They need to take a serious look at this product.  DO NOT BUY!!

review/summary: The Best Wet Cat Ever - Whiskas Perfectly Fish Tuna Entree
review/text: Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food my cats will eat. Obviously many cats feel the same way since the grocery stores are usually out of this selection.  There are many other flavors available; but like I said, Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food for my babies, Comanche and Lakota.  Thank you so much.
