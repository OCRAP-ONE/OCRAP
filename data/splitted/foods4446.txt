review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: I simply do not like the taste. I was expecting something more like what I have received at food resturants, but this just doesn't taste right to me.  I even added some sugar, thinking maybe that was it, but it still tastes bad to me. My enire family avoids it, so I assume they also do not like it, otherwise it would be gone.  That said, Green Moutain does make some excellent produtcs, in fact "Nantucket" is my favorite coffee.

review/text: The other reviewer was correct. It had a strong coconut taste but also had that nasty aftertaste that some of those cheap sugar substite products contain. My boyfried said it's almost like a liquorice (sp) aftertaste.  I ordered a huge thing of it b/c my son loves this flavor and he won't touch it again either.  I guess that's one we'll toss out and cut as a loss.

review/summary: Ideal diet for a Rhodesian Ridgeback
review/text: This is the only food our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has ever eaten (plus a single square of Kraft American cheese daily as a treat and a few chicken breast treats.)  Kramer is in great health and people are always amazed at how fit and strong he is.  That he still has all his teeth is surely attributable to the Active Care hard kibble diet and the near absolute lack of any signs of arthritis must be one of the benefits of the "healthy joint formula."  Both Kramer and I cannot recommend Active Care highly enough.

review/text: Ok, my first exposure to yerba mate was with Rosamonte and that stuff is awesome. I had read that Canarias is the most popular seller in Uruguay and is a no-stem, high caffeine style of yerba. The flavor is quite different from Rosamonte and the density of the small cut leaves is high so you will get an occasional particle through the filter. Does seem to be more caffeine but that's just my unscientific perception. I plan to try several more brands before picking a favorite. Pretty great. It takes much more water to "wash" out the flavor. More economical? Try it.

review/text: I love, love, love Carr's Ginger Lemon Cremes.<br /><br />Ginger and lemon are a natural combination. Usually the lemon is overwhelmed by the ginger, but in these cookies the lemon is just right.<br /><br />I also like these because I prefer ginger without molasses (ginger cookies, not ginger snaps).<br /><br />Since they're sandwich cookies, they're fun to eat. And once you start eating them, the flavor is so stimulating it's hard to stop.<br /><br />They're perfect as tea cookies - when people must mind their manners, not yield to temptation and slowly savor the whole package, one cookie right after another.<br /><br />I just wish the fat used in them were a bit healthier.

review/text: All right, maybe the title is just a little exaggeration. Carr's starts with two crispy ginger cookies that have tiny gingery bite, but are complimented by a sweet molasses flavor. The two cookies sandwich a bright, but not too sweet lemon cr&egrave;me which cuts the sweetness of the cookie, and adds a creamy texture to compliment the crisp cookie.  I'm a big fan of Ginger Snaps. Carr's adding lemon cr&egrave;me, pure genius. Of course if you're not fond of ginger cookies, this one may not float your boat. I call it a great find.

NOTE: THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT HORRIBLY BAD.... BUT NOT AS TASTY AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BASED ON THE ABOVE REVIEWS....

review/text: This product as packaged was advertised at $14.99 but I was billed $19.99.  That's $6.66 per 7.05 ounce pack.  Had I checked the Carr website I'd have found that any local CVS Pharmacy carries the same product in 7.05 ounce packages, and had I visited my local CVS I could have bought the cookies for $3.69 per 7.05 ounce pack.

review/summary: Less expensive? I'm using more per glass
review/text: I bought Raspberry Ice because it cost less than my previous flavors, raspberry tea, peach tea and antioxidant green tea raspberry. What I discovered is that it takes more powder to flavor the glass of water. So I'm not sure there is a savings. What's more, it lacks the subtlety of the other flavors, all three of which I enjoy much more. Perhaps it's because it's not one of the "tea" choices, it veers towards Kool-ade territory. I'm also not thrilled that it stained my clear hard plastic "on-the-go" thermos, but that may not be an issue for you. In short, it's good enough, but I find myself wanting to use it up, even as I want to drink up the others.

review/summary: This gets me the daily water intake I need... thank goodness.
review/text: Ok.  A few things.<br /><br />(1) I am not generally a big raspberry flavor fan.  It tends to be too sweet for me.  Yet I love Crystal Light Raspberry Ice.  I have no explanation.<br /><br />(2) I have not been a big water fan.  I used to have to force myself to drink my daily allotment.  Then I found Crystal Light.  I tried a BUNCH of flavors - some I HATED and some were OK and some I liked quite a lot.  Then I found Crystal Light Raspberry Ice.  And promptly ordered three cases.  YAY!!  It's yummy.  I make a two-quart batch before I go to bed and I have it chilled the next day.  I have some singletons (which Amazon also sells - link at end of review) that I use in the office, but I don't mind naked water so much now.  Probably because I don't have to drink so much of it.  Heh.<br /><br />A lot of my gym-friends use Crystal Light - and some have different flavors that are their fav, but I have found a lot of people who also love Raspberry Ice.<br /><br />I intend to start trying a whole bunch more flavors, so I have multiple flavors to rely on and not have to worry about getting tired of my one favorite, but for now.. Raspberry Ice!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4HJE">Crystal Light On the Go, Raspberry Ice, 0.6-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a>

Unfortunately for my family, our palates seem to have been ruined by years of cheaper, artificial cheese puffs. These just didn't taste quite right to us. I gave it the old college try and gradually ate an entire bag over the course of a half week, and they never did grow on me the way I was hoping.<br /><br />They're clearly a high quality product, they just didn't have a cheese puff flavor which went over properly with my family.

review/text: The 1st bite I took, I'll admit I wasn't sold. It doesn't taste like your typical cheese puff. However, upon a second taste I found I actually like them better. They do have a little more of a corn-taste, but because they're made with corn. This was listed as a negative in some other reviews, but I like being able to identify what I'm eating, so it was a plus. My kids love these even more than the kind they used to get. I don't think we'll be switching back to our old brand, in fact we're running low, I may have to buy some more soon!

It is owned by a state-owned Chinese company called Bright Foods based in Shanghai. Do your research. Barbara's Bakery is owned by Weetabix Limited which is owned by the Chinese government. No wonder why the quality of Barbara's Bakery has gone down hill.

review/summary: GMO's and pesticides!!!!
review/text: I have been letting my autistic daughter eat a bag of these every week for the past few years.  Since they were stocked at my local natural foods co-op and claimed to be "natural" I just assumed that they would come from GMO free corn.  It was not until I read the Cornucopia Institute's "Cereal Crimes" report that I read about so called "natural" cereals containing plenty of GMO's and pesticide residues, and often at a higher price than the organics.  Most of Barbara's Bakery's cereals are not organic so I looked a little closer at the ingredients on these cheese puffs too and realized that if we had wanted GMO's and pesticides just about any brand would have been fine.  I do admit though that Barbara's have a good taste.<br /><br />  "Natural" is a worthless title.  Best to stick with USDA certified organics.  I am switching to the Little Bear original baked cheese puffs instead. I didn't care for their Lite Cheese Puffs but he Baked are good.  Amazon has them at a reasonable price. We don't need GMO corn with a genetically engineered Bt pesticide circulating in our guts.<br /><br />  Barbara's Bakery, stop the deceptive advertising and provide an organic version of these!

review/summary: Best Turkey Jerky that I've tried
review/text: I've tried some options on amazon.com such as Jack Link's Turkey Jerky and Turkey Nuggets, Snackmasters Range Brown Turkey Jerky, Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, among others from various retail outlets. Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there.

review/text: I'm a really big fan of the Jack Link's peppered beef jerky, but it can be hit or miss with the freshness. This stuff was pretty good though. I think the Jack Link's has a better taste due to more flavourings (the secret is in the soy sauce they use, I suspect) where this has a cleaner beef taste which some might like more.<br /><br />I think the beef strips in this brand are a bit too thick, but maybe that's just me.

review/text: The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste. To me, the flavor was a little overwhelming. There was no turkey flavor. Just the sweetness of the Teriyaki. I think 7 grams of sugar in a 1-ounce serving (1/3 of a package) seems like a lot. And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness. Too much sweetness for me.

review/text: Having had Jack Links jerky for a while I picked up this brand during one of Amazon's deals to try it out. While it is nice and the smokey flavour works well, there is a much sweeter flavour to it than Jack Links brand. Personally this puts me off this brand a little although others in my house do like the sweeter flavour.<br /><br />So it really depends what you want in your Teriyaki jerky and if you like it sweet or not.<br /><br />The jerky pieces are a good size though, they definitely give you some big jerky.

The flour is finely diced and clean white in color as it is blanched.<br /><br />Used it for a gluten-free brownie recipe and for baking some simple breads and macarons - Taste came out perfect. Definitely noticed a difference when compared to almond meal (which used the skin of the almond). Unblanched almond flour simply does not work for baking IMO.<br /><br />Product got shipped within hours of ordering as well - fedex ground ;)

review/summary: So thankful for almond flour...
review/text: It's hard enough dealing with food allergies -- but the added costs of dealing with them are demanding, too. It's wonderful to find a product that I can order on-line that costs less than store-brands. The quality of this particular almond flour is wonderful: nicely ground (very fine!) without clumping. This will be on my re-order list for sure!

review/summary: Unbelievably Bad.
review/text: I really don't understand how anyone could eat these crackers. They taste awful when you first put them in your mouth and the aftertaste is even worse. I have just started a gluten free diet so I'm still used to regular crackers and I can tell you that these are no where near the real thing. And now having invested in this three pack, I'm going to have to toss them all out. I'm usually pretty flexible about flavor and I really hate to throw out food, but these are so bad that the taste actually upset my stomach. I had to suck on a mint afterwards to get the flavor out of my mouth. A complete waste of time and money.

My husband still doesn't understand quite how much I love these crackers.  They taste (to me) EXACTLY like Banquet brand pot pie CRUST.  Since that is one of the things I really miss, I was so delighted to have found these crackers.  We have used them with different soups as a replacement for bread.  These crackers don't taste like any regular crackers I've had, though.  But that's fine with me.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Crackers
review/text: I've tried several brands of gluten-free crackers, and this one is by far my favorite.  It's just as good as "normal" crackers, and it's not as gritty as other gluten-free snacks.  The only downside is that there's a good amount of broken pieces, and you don't get very much per box.  Other than that, it's a great product and worth the price.

review/summary: The only good salt substitute
review/text: Potassium chloride tastes terrible.  Let me say that again.  Potassium chloride, the "salt" that makes up salt substitutes tastes really, really bad.  Sure.  It's salty.  But it's not salty in the way that sodium chloride is salty.  Adding flavors to it doesn't help (ie garlic salt substitute is just as horrible as regular salt substitute).  Neither does adding lysine.  Nosalt and Also Salt....both terrible.<br /><br />So what do you do if you are like the average person who has severe sodium/potassium imbalance leading to high blood pressure? Get Losalt.  Lord almighty, it's only 1/3 sodium chloride and 2/3 potassium chloride and it tastes almost exactly like real salt.  More importantly, it actually tastes good.  As in you won't cringe putting this stuff on your food.  Who would have thought mixing the potassium chloride with sodium chloride (regular salt) would make it palatable.<br /><br />There is room for improvement.  For example, I'd love it if this stuff came in different ratios.  You get used to 1/3 sodium chloride then, after a few months, lower it to like 10%.  Who knows how much real salt needs to be in there to make it bearable (5%? less).  Also, a healthy dose of magnesium would be nice.  Magnesium deficiency is one of the major players in high blood pressure and pain in the rear to supplement.<br /><br />But let's not get sidetracked here.  The bottom line is, if you are reading this, your probably have high blood pressure and are desperately looking for a salt substitute that won't make you puke.  This is the only one.  I've tried them all.

I was so disappointed when the company closed down.  I was worried when I opened the package that they would just not taste the same but fear not, they are just as I remember.  The cookies look the same, feel the same, taste the same!  I am so happy they are back and my children enjoy them just as much as I did when I was their age.

review/summary: An exquisite cookie!
review/text: Mother's Cookies have been around forever here on the west coast.  I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).  I am glad Kellogg's bought the company and brought them back.  I recently tried the Vanilla Creme cookie not knowing what to expect.  I was used to the Circus Animals and their delicious chocolate chip cookie over the years since I was a child.  Their Vanilla Creme cookie is just out of this world and makes me glad I have a mouth!  That's how good they are.  It is an exquisite cookie.  No coffee or tea should be served to company without these.  Your friends will wonder what they are and where they come from!<br /><br />In addition to being a great tasting cookie I love the design and texture of the cookie.  I feel really regal when I eat them.  I introduced these to the whole family and I got everyone eating them.  The local supermarket had a sale on them at two dollars a package and I ended up buying seven of them.<br /><br />If you like the taste of vanilla and are looking for a good cookie to try or just plain like cookies, you won't be disappointed with these!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to write a review for Mother's English Tea cookie but apparently Amazon has all the reviews linked to all Mother's cookies products and will only accept one review.<br /><br />I wanted to write that that English Tea cookie by Mother's is just as good as the Vanilla Cremes.  I am not sure but I thought I detected a slight banana flavor but very subtle.  They certainly don't taste like vanilla but they are a really good cookie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s Mother's Cookies used to put out a variety pack and that's how I discovered their delicious chocolate chip cookie.  It has a chocolate chip taste so different than any other chocolate chip cookie I've eaten.<br /><br />I understand Mother's cookies are hard to find for much of the country except on the west coast.  The fact that Amazon sells them is a good thing.  So if you're wondering if you should give them a try, please believe me, they're all high quality cookies and taste great regardless if they become a favorite or not.  I am very fussy when it comes to food but Mother's cookies are so delicious that I am working my way to try every cookie they offer.  Vanilla Creme is by far my favorite.  As a side note, if your cookies should arrive crumbled or broken, it's the responsibility of the buyer to contact Amazon and complain.  Amazon has friendly customer service and will correct the problem if you complain.

review/summary: Can't get enough of this!!!
review/text: I do not usually eat sweets, as I find most American made desserts too sweet for me. However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place! Enjoy your cookies =) Thanks for reading!

review/summary: Mother's Sack-of-Fat Cookies [Caveat Emptor]
review/text: The English Tea and Peanut Butter Gaucho cookies, by Mother's, are probably the best tasting sandwich cookies I've ever eaten. However, this nirvana of the cookie munching experience, comes at a pretty hefty price. As I was gleefully polishing off the first bag, I happened to glance at the nutritional stats on the back. To my astonishment and horror, I found that just two cookies delivered 2.5 grams of saturated fat, 2 grams of trans fat, and a whopping 180 calories! For this reason, I removed one rating star and won't be purchasing these again, until this problem is resolved. C'mon Kelloggs, get yer 'stuff' in one bag and cut the trans fat! Sure, the saturated fat content is rather high, but the trans fat is not only unacceptable, it is entirely unnecessary. These cookies could easily be baked with lighter oils like canola, sunflower, or safflower. If you truly must, buy these cookies at your own risk, or better still, fear for your poor arteries and beg-off! [English Tea - 5, Peanut Butter Gauchos - 5, Iced Lemonade - 4, Iced Oatmeal - 3]

review/text: My Mom & I were itchin for a late-nite snack while on vacation out west with the rest of the family; we wandered accross the street from our motel & entered a grocery store. We tried these cookies & thought they were delicious -- small, bite-size tasty cookies w/o too many chips like Chips A;Hoy, etc. When we got back to Cleveland, Ohio, I tried to find them at our local drug stores. Eventually, I found out they are not available east of the Mississippi. ...Really obsessing over a chocolate chip cookie, I found them on a site called 'foodlocker.com'. But after Katrina, they were put out of order (that's unfortunate). One day a few years later, I thought I'd search Amazon, & my cookie-journey had a happy ending. I just wish Mom was still with us to enjoy.

The cookies are also slightly less brittle than they used to be, giving them a better bite and leading to less loose crumbs.
