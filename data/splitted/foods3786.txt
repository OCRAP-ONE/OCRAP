review/summary: Perfect cookies!
review/text: I have to admit I expected these cookies to be mediocre since they are "organic". Most of the time organic prepared foods mean "flavored with fruit juice instead of real sugar". Yes, I love sugar even if it is bad for me and these cookies balance sugar, chocolate, and vanilla perfectly. My biggest problem will be not eating too many of them since they come in bulk. I'm just hoping they last 2 weeks!<br /><br />Now I plan to buy the other flavors of this brand.

review/summary: Best cookies I've ever had!!
review/text: These are the best cookies I've ever had.  I was never a fan of oreo-type cookies until I tasted these!!  With a really nice cookie outside and a mint creme that is delicious (they're not too minty but just right), you will LOVE these cookies!!  I am now a fan - and the fact that they're organic is an added bonus.

review/summary: Crunchy & minty
review/text: UPS just delivered them so of course I had to try them before lunch. The chocolate wafer is nice and crisp and the mint creme center has a moderate mint flavor. If you take the wafer apart like one would do for an Oreo, the center is a bit gritty like the sugar wasn't fully blended. However I still prefer these over an Oreo since the combined flavor is wonderful and they are organic. Now I wish I'd purchased the oatmeal and chocolate chip while the coupon offer existed. These small 6 packages will disappear too quickly at my house.

review/summary: A little disappointed in Amazon Grocery...
review/text: I ordered the ginger lemon cremes, but was very disappointed to find Amazon screwing up so badly.  The outside of the box as shipped from the vendor to Amazon clearly says "VANILLA" in very large letters, but Amazon slapped a sticker with a barcode on it that tags the box of cookies as "ginger lemon cremes," so now instead of enjoying the ginger lemon cremes I had been looking forward to tasting, I have to go through the hassle of trying to return these and hopefully get Amazon to send me the right product a second time around.  So, now I have to wait to see if I actually get ginger lemon cremes in another few weeks or however long Amazon takes.  Boy, their service has gotten worse and worse every year since I started buying stuff from Amazon back in their early days.

review/summary: You will never buy another kind of stock!
review/text: I have been using More Than Gourmet for about a year, and I cannot go back to supermarket stock (even the higher end market stuff).  MTG is so much better than anything out there.  You can actually taste the "roasting" that created these reductions.  My current favorite is the chicken (this product), and I use it for cooking meats and grains, as an au jus for sandwiches, and as a base for simple sauces.  It's even good straight up with toast points!  The turkey is also a favorite, and is indispensible for October through December recipes. Very glad that Amazon is now carrying this line; very high quality and very good company (found a market niche, answered my customer service questions promptly and with a great attitude).

review/summary: Indispensible!
review/text: If you're a working person and need some quick tasty meals on the table after work, well you're pretty much relegated to fast food or bland food. Well, no more! With these in your fridge or on your shelf you will have quick tasty meals in no time. For this particular one just take a few boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs and saute them over high heat a few minutes, until browned and cooked through. Remove them from the pan and add a finely chopped shallot and saute that until it softens a bit, add a bit of white wine (optional) and some chopped herbs of your choice. Then add in the contents of this little cup and some water, a bit more than a cup, boil over high heat until reduced some and serve over the chicken. I love all the au jus' put out by MTG so much I ordered the larger containers so I never run out. Try adding some of this to your home made chicken soup to up the flavor too. Put it in waterever liquid you usually cook your rice in..........the list of uses for this is endless, it enhances everything.

review/summary: Great on it's own or as a filler: is gluten free
review/text: Contrary to it's name, this is actually a seed and is gluten free.  Very easy to cook, cooks like couscous: add hot water and leave to cook, or you can simmer at low heat for no more than 10 minutes.  Ends up soft, not fluffy, and I usually add a vegetable stock like mushroom, or chicken and it absorbs the flavors.<br /><br />I also use this as a substitute for bulged in recipes and acts as a great combo with any meatball dishes (reduce the meat content) and is a great filler.  We can't taste the grain in the meatball at all!  Use instead of rice or potato.<br /><br />A little goes a long way, so although each packet appears small, you actually find a cup of grain wil feed at least 6 people.<br /><br />I wished amazon did a smaller amount like 6 per delivery for those who do not have a lot of storage space.

review/summary: Good, but not very spicy
review/text: I was impressed with the taste and quality of other Virginia Diner products, so I gave these a try.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  Like all Virginia Diner peanut products, they came vacuum-sealed with a heavy liner keeping the vacuum in.  You'll hear the hiss when you break the seal.  The nuts are fresh and crunchy.<br /><br />However, the product picture makes them either look larger than they are, or it makes the container look smaller than it is.  These are average-sized peanuts, the same size as you would buy in the store.  The container is larger than it looks in the picture.  The nuts are mostly halves, with a few whole nuts and very few pieces.<br /><br />They are not as spicy as the title "Cajun" would suggest.  At first, you barely notice the spice.  It builds a little as you eat more, but not very much.  A nice flavor, but less than I expected.  Minus one star for not being (nearly) spicy enough, but four stars for the superior quality.

review/text: We (I work at a small grocery store) ordered this item at the suggestion of a customer.  When I got around to trying one, WOW!  The drink is sweet, but not overly so, and quite ginger-y.  I love the taste of ginger.  As far as the kick goes, I think it's perfect.  Enough to get you going, but not so much that you won't be able to sleep.<br /><br />I have Raynaud's Syndrome.  Basically, my hands are always cold.  When they become very cold, they hurt pretty badly and turn blue.  Temperature and stress are the main bullies to trigger these attacks.  Caffeine is not good for me either, as it constricts your blood vessels.  For some reason, I can drink this stuff without any bad side effects.  This fact and the taste are why I continue to drink Reed's Energy Elixir.

Personally, I'd like a little less almond and whole lot more spice, but that's me.<br /><br />Harney and Sons teas came in silk sachets, each sachet can brew two cups of tea.  The directions for brewing are on the side of the tin.  This tea does come in very handsome tins.  The tea inside the sachets is real, loose tea, it isn't leftover sludge, and it is in the convenience of a tea bag.  I have done a lot of tea tasting in my time and I prefer the quality I got from Harney and Sons, it consistantly exceeds my expectations.

review/summary: My cats love it
review/text: My cats (7 of them between 3 years old and 18 years old) have been eating Iams for many many years. I have never had any problems and they are all healthy. All their coats are shiny too. One of my cats loves for me to put this Iams in a food ball so he can roll it around and eat the food that falls out of it. I also feed my cats 9 Lives daily essentials - salmon, chicken, and beef flavor. None of my cats have any digestive issues and have been eating this combination for many years.<br />The Iams is in a separate bowl dry, as well as in another bowl that I put water on it. The 9 Lives are in separate bowls next to the Iams, and they both get eaten equally. This is a nice variety for them and it works great for me. Amazon has great prices on this Iams and on the 15 lb bag of the 9 lives too. I am a prime subscriber, so shipping is also free.<br /><br />I have tried all brands of cat food, from expensive to really cheapo stuff. This combination works really well as their digestive system is healthy and the litter box is not overly offensive either (like the cheapo garbage I have tried). We also used to foster cats, and they never had any issues with the Iams or 9 Lives combination at all.<br /><br />Give the Iams a try, your cat will thank you for it. Just remember to give it about a week for your cats system to get used to changing their food.

review/summary: Exactly what it claims --
review/text: I've always ended up with Monin syrups -- after trying 1/2 dozen other brands, I always come back to their pure cane sugar, low preservative, high varity, and good flavor.  So I tried the strawberry puree -- to see if it had anything wrong with it, quite frankly.  But -- NOPE.  It's just what it says it is.  Shelf stable like canned fruit, but in varieties unavailable in canned fruit -- and for roughly the same price as frozen, but without getting freezer burned or taking up scarce freezer space.<br /><br />Great in mixed drinks and lemonade; great as a little punch in smoothies.  And I assume excellent over ice cream, though we haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />I'm going back for more flavors!!!!!!!!

review/summary: A bit of home (from long ago)
review/text: This is probably an acquired taste, but growing up in England I acquired it.  It makes a plate of cold cuts or cheese so much more tasty.  It consists of a slightly thickened, tasty, brown sauce containing chopped pickle-like material (about twice the size of pieces in pickle relish but there the resemblance to relish ends.  It's great to be able to get this delivered - I used to buy bottles to bring back from England but it's heavy to lug in one's suitcase - and there's the danger of breakage - it's best to put it on your cheese before you put it on your clothes.

Six bottles lasts me just long enough, though I don't know why there so much slightly different, but almost identical, packaging.<br /><br />I can also get single bottles at locally at Stater Bros, but that's a store I don't go in all that often (too far away).

review/text: I hadn't had this in over 20 years...when I had my first Ploughman's lunch in London.  I thought it was fantastic, but had no idea what the name was.  I came across this on Amazon, and since my family is condiment happy, I decided to try it...BINGO!  It was London all over again. I split a lightly buttered crumpet, and put smoked turkey on one half and spreadable cheddar on the other. With the pickle on the top, it made a heavenly supper.  This reminds me of a really high class mincemeat, without the tooth cracking sweetness.<br /><br />The price was right, and the packaging was perfect.  It will be worth your while to get more than one jar, because you'll want to use this on EVERYTHING!

review/summary: Great Coffee - But don't buy it here.
review/text: The coffee is rich and delicious... a great way to start the day or to end an evening meal.  But at $1.00 a cup it is way overpriced.  I bought my Nespresso coffee machine from an Amazon dealer.  The price was very good.  So I assumed that the cost of the coffee would be good as well.  I performed a Google internet search for the lowest prices on Nespresso coffee, and all search results linked to Amazon.  So I ordered 50 cups and paid $1.00 a cup.  Then, a few days later I found that I could order the same coffee directly from the Nespresso website for only $0.60 a cup.  This shows you how skewed the Google Search Engine is and also reveals that the "deals" on Amazon are not always good deals.<br /><br />Lessons learned: 1) The coffee is great!  2) Do not trust Google as a reliable source to point you in the direction YOU want to go in.  It only points you in the direction they want to take you in.  3) Buy your coffee directly from Nespresso and save 40% (and get faster shipping as well.)  4) Do not rely on Amazon for the best deals.

review/summary: Taste of the Movies
review/text: This product was GREAT!  If you want your popcorn to taste anything like it does in the theaters then you will need coconut oil.  Don't be surprised, it is SUPPOSED to be a solid.  If it is not a solid then something is wrong.  It melts easily once you put it in the popper.<br /><br />My only complaint is there is no good way to get the "oil" out of the tub, other than just taking a spoon and digging in. Because of this, it is hard to "dig out" the same amount consistently.<br /><br />If you find that you that you do like using coconut oil over the other kinds (corn, canola etc...) then I would recommend buying the case instead<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WLXK38">1# Jar Colored Coconut Oil, 12 per Case</a>. Granted you will have oil for a long time, but you are saving a HUGE amount of money and coconut oil has a really long shelf life.<br /><br />Keep in mind, Coconut oil alone will not get you the perfect tasting popcorn.  You will also need butter and salt, the most popular route is to get butter flavored salt (do not use stick or tub butter, wrong kind of butter).  I am still experimenting with different ones, but the ACT II butter salt is not bad (but can be very powerful so be careful how much you use).<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has their own popcorn maker, as it makes all the difference in the world.

review/text: La Chinata brand is DOG (guaranteed origin of denomination) from the La Vera region of Spain.  This is the real one that is smoked over real oak for almost two weeks and ground to a silky powder (think cocoa) rather that the gritty stuff produced here in the U.S.  Rather than just for garnish (which I do as well), it's a powerbomb of aroma and flavor.<br />All you need to do to understand the flavor profile is to start by making a compound with hot butter or some mayonnaise, and taste it.  Before you know it, it starts going on roast chicken, scampi, all chops, rice and noodle dishes, chicken and egg salads, infused oils and sauces.  It adds gorgeous color to everything you put it in.  Every review here so far is five stars.  Try it now!

review/text: This is a necessity for paella and even other Latina or southwest cooking. You cannot get the same taste from the regular Hungarian sweet or hot paprika. There is a backnote of smokiness that you cannot deny. As others have mentioned, this is a very multi-functional seasoning, you cannot go wrong; and with all three flavors (sweet, hot and bittersweet), you've got ALL your bases covered. I purchase this item many times not only for myself but for others who are always happy to receive it b/c it is not readily found in markets.

review/summary: Did not ship the brand listed, and got 3 cans of Hot instead of the variety pack.
review/text: After searching reviews on amazon, I chose to order this brand due to name recongnition and high reviews on this particular brand, La Tienda. The picture shows 3 cans of La Tienda, but what you get is another brand entirely: some brand called SPP, different tin, different label, different brand. Not affiliated whatsoever with La Tienda. Futhermore, the picture clearly shows a variety pack- one can of HOT one can of SWEET and one can of BITTERSWEET. I got three cans of HOT.<br /><br />Since the packaging is entirely in spanish, I cannot discern if this is a reputable brand or producer, nor can I know if this brand is a cheap substitute for the brand I thought I was getting. Since I am not an expert on Spanish Smoked Paprika, I decided to just go with a seemingly well known brand and not take a chance on a brand I never heard of. For all I know this could be a store brand or generic and not produced to the standards of the brand he is advertising.<br /><br />Seller needs to take down the picture and relist with what you are actually getting. If you are brand conscious, go elsewhwere. The brand I received, "SPP" is not being sold by any one on amazon, and I can't actually find ANY information about this brand at all.

review/text: This tea is really good. I saw it on Dr. Oz and went on a mad hunt all over the city trying to find and everyone was sold out. But of course Whole Foods has it for $10.00 a tin....so I broke down and bought it to try and it is great. Then I came back to my trusty Amazon store and low and behold the same tea offered with my favorite way to order "Subscribe and Save" for 3 pack with the added bonus of free shipping and handling. So not only is it being delivered straight to my door on the regular, I save 10.00 purchasing that way...so that is 1 tin free buying from Amazon versus purchasing at Whole Foods! Now that's a bargain...can't beat it with a stick! I love Amazon. Another benefit is you can steep the same leaves 2-3 times. Love, love, love it!!! Will check back to report health benefits...Doing all 4 teas recommended by Dr. Oz, pu-erh (2 cups in AM) White tea (2 cups mid morning), Chickweed (1 cup mid afternoon) and Bilberry (1 cup evening. Luckily was able to find the last three teas at local health food store...but everyone must be doing this because they only had 1 box each left on the shelf...so I asked for them to order more and I will stock up for six months when the products come in....great alternative to coffee!

review/summary: Lovely for coffee drinkers!
review/text: I bought this from amazon about 6 years ago and just re-found 1 can in my pantry.<br /><br />Amazingly enough the tea is still WONDERFUL.  Now I do not recommend forgetting about anything for 6 years and then trying it, but my family is into 'human-test-subjects' and I was served some without my knowing it.  I love this tea.<br /><br />The other reviews saying that this tea helps you stay alert - I concur totally.  We are hardcore coffee drinkers, and this tea is a fabulous substitute!

review/text: I noticed I become extremely happy after drinking this tea.....<br /><br />It seemed like this tea has a lot of caffeine. (I'm not sure if it does have a lot but I feel like it has a lot)<br />Drinking 2~3 cups makes me very awake, energetic, and happy.<br /><br />After drinking more than 3 cups of it on an empty stomach, I even feel little shaky.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea for those who need a lot of energy.<br />I personally drink this tea every day. Love it.

review/summary: So what if it is good for you.  This tea tastes fabulous.
review/text: There are claims about the health benefits of this tea - helps digestion, blood pressure, cholesterol etc.  But what I like best is the taste.  I have never had such a wonderfully mild and well balanced dark tea.  There is no bitterness or sharpness - none.  Yet the tea will brew to the darkness of coffee but with a pleasing earthy brown.  It definitely leans towards the earthy and malty flavors but in a wonderfully mild way.  To top it all off, it is organic.

review/summary: Smoothest tea ever
review/text: I am not so much a tea drinker as a coffee drinker, but my husband is very into his teas, so I bought this as a gift and now we're both addicted.  This tea is mellow and smooth, dark and tasty, and a single tablespoon can be reused for a second cup, and even a third depending on how long it steeps.  I also gave one tin of the three to a friend who is similarly enthralled with this product and she is what I would call a tea connoisseur.  Definitely worth the price...big bang for the buck here! AND Dr. Oz recently said it's a great for weight loss...who knew?!

review/text: I've been drinking pu erh tea for about 7 years and have tried many varieties.  this is my current favorite.  I like this tea better than rishi's Ginger version because I add my own fresh Ginger to the tea every morning, which is more flavorful.  the deep earthiness and full body of the pu erh goes well with the Ginger.  I also sometimes add cream and sweetener, which I'm sure is barbaric to tea experts, but is really pleasant nonetheless.  thanks for a great product, Rishi!

The plain tastes more like black tea and is great with lemon and mint. This flavor was ok but thats just my personal taste preference - if you dont like ginger, dont get it - if you do like ginger you will probably like it.

review/summary: Great food to keep an older dog healthy!
review/text: Our dog is very healthy and happy on this food! He has no digestive or skin issues and he is never sick. He's an 8 year old American Eskimo Dog. We walk him a LOT, but he still doesn't need to eat as much as the package indicates. He eats the "weight loss" amount, but he's not losing weight, he's maintaining his weight. This isn't a complaint at all, but if you're going to feed this food to an older dog or a dog with a slower metabolism, monitor their weight carefully and make sure you're not feeding too much!

review/summary: Great high quality dog food
review/text: I have two golden retrievers with hearty appetites.  Feeding them regular dog food makes them overweight.  I switched to Core Reduced Fat when I began to worry about the quality of the food I was feeding my dogs.  I had fed my dogs expensive dog foods which I got at the grocery store.  When I read the ingredients, I decied to look for something better quality.  From my research I learned that high quality dog foods prevent illness and disease and increase life-span.  Core is made with ingredients like real chicken--not chicken by-products or lots of grain.  Afterall, dogs are carnivores.  Since my dogs have been on Core they have not had the usual ear infections, skin allergies and irritations; their coats are beautiful; they have lots of energy and are overall very healthy.  The extra money I pay for this high quality dog food I definitely save at the vet!

At other retailers I have seen this bag of food cost $10-15 more (sometimes even more than that).

review/text: For what it's worth, my 9lb. yorkie-poo loves this food, more than the other types of Wellness. The local Petco carries every flavor but this, so I have to order it on-line, but it is really worth it. Whenever I read about a dog having "..re-newed energy", or "...a shinier coat", I always scoff because that has never been the case with my dog. Even with the foods he loves, but with this particular type of dog food with this particular company, I have to say it's true. I tried all of the various Wellness foods, and he was okay with them, but this is the only one that he's ever really emptied the bowl, every time. That includes the Super 5 Max, or whatever it's called, the food for smaller dogs that somehow finds grains acceptable.

review/text: The pieces are VERY hard.. in fact, too hard for my 12+ year old to eat dry. I have to soak it in some beef or chicken broth in order for him to be able to eat it. I have never purchased grain free dog food, so I don't have any real comparison and it may all be this way. I do however always buy low-fat food. I tried the grain free because my dogs get dry, itchy skin and thought it might help. I have no idea how the taste is, because I don't eat it, but I did try biting into a piece to see how hard it was and it was. My dogs seem to like it as long as it's softened for them though.

review/summary: Helped my dog loses weight
review/text: I have two basset hounds and they tend to have weight problem especially since they have a mommy that dooesn't like to see them go hungry.  I feel good giving my babies this food because this company has a good reputation and they are consistently on the many lists of good pet food by independent raters.  I feed my babies half dry kibble and half home cooked chicken, turkey, beef fresh meats, and they also get daily multivitamins.  Jake actually host 2 lbs so he will get to keep the same amount bMy problem is that they get too much treats, mainly because I give them treats every time I have to give them medication or clean their ears.  So I decrease the food amount at breakfast and dinner to make up for the daily treats.  I also add some warm water to the dry kibble and let it soften the food, then add probiotic powder when cooled, and home coooked meats and vitamins. I like this brand as well as the Blue Buffalo and the Simple Life brands.  I wish Simple Life will make weight management foods.  I like the foods that are kept in special type of metallic zip lock bags to help keep it fresh.  Make sure you check the expiration date and odor to ensure the foods are not expired or have "off" odors.

review/summary: Wise switch from Iams Low Residue Formula
review/text: When my Rhodesian Ridgeback-mix developed mild pancreatitis two years ago at age three, my vet suggested Iams Low Residue food.  Over the last year, however, she's also developed severe skin allergies (but mostly air-borne, I think)and was losing hair in small patches so, after some research I added MSM to her diet and decided to eliminate grain. Wellness CORE Grain-Free food was the perfect choice because it is also low-fat (too much fat aggrevating her pancreas).  In the month she's been on it--both dry and wet formula--her coat has improved and she even seems perkier!

review/summary: Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!
review/text: Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is "sub-par" compared to the "very top" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the "cons" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

His digestive system is a mess, and recently we learned his pancreas  numbers were off as well. This is why we decided to go low fat.<br /><br />It has been 12 days and the improvement is remarkable. We finally have good poop. It's a miracle!  PLUS he liked it right away as well.<br /><br />I researched dozens of dog foods over the last 6 months, and recently at least 6 low fat dry foods. This one appeared to be the best, and it is definitely the best for our dog!  We are VERY HAPPY with our choice. Plus it magically comes to the door via UPS.

review/summary: GREAT Dog Food
review/text: This is wonderful food, and would recommend it to anyone with a dog needing to lose weight, with a sensitive stomach, or allergies.  I had my toy poodle on Iams for 7 years.  I never did research on dog food, the breeder I bought her from had started her on Iams, so I continued on it.  She steadily put on weight over the years, & I switched to Iams Weight Control.  After continuing to gain weight, and just generally have no energy at all, I thought it's time for a drastic change.  At this point, I did A LOT of research on dry dog food.  I wish I had done this years ago!  I came to find out, that a lot of the well know brands, do not have quality ingredients.  After lots of research, I decided the Wellness Core Reduced Fat Grain Free was our best option.  She's been on it now for 5 months, and has went from nearly 8.5 lbs to just barely over 7, and still counting.  She seems to feel so much better.  AND...she loves the food too!

review/summary: Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!
review/text: Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is "sub-par" compared to the "very top" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the "cons" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: OH, WHAT'S THAT?
review/text: Beaux and Ozzie smelled it coming through the door.  Oh, what's that?  Food!!  Then when I opened the bag and poured it out, they gave me the meanest look.  They wouldn't touch it.  I mixed with some off the shelf dry food.  No Joy!.  Finally ended dousing it with some chicken broth.  That got their attention.  Risk Reward decisions were quickly calculated and they ate.  Must do this now every time until the bag is gone.  $3.00/lb down the drain.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: Late delivery
review/text: So far, after using the brand of dog food for two weeks, it appears to be good dog food.  My problem is with the additional amount I paid to have it delivered on Saturday from this company.  It is now Monday after 10:30 and there is still no delivery.  If I receive a refund for the expedited delivery I will return and amend the feedback.

review/summary: The ultimate super food!
review/text: If you already know about wakame, then you don't need to read this review. If you don't, you should, because this is one of the greatest and most versatile staples you can keep in your kitchen. Wakame is a mild, slightly salty, tasty seaweed that is full of nutrients and flavor. However, you'd starve to death if you tried to live off this, because it has almost no calories. There are a number of ways you can prepare this. As a soup base, it's quite awesome - just simmer a half cup in a pot of water, add miso, soy sauce, or ponzu, and then spike it with frozen shrimp, thin sliced pork, or whatever else you'd like to toss in. Add a dash of sriracha and sesame oil, and you've got a great-tasting low-calorie soup that beats the pants off anything you can get in a can. If you want some carbs in there, add any kind of noodle you like, from vermicelli to udon. Because the wakame itself adds so much flavor, you don't really need to overload it with sodium-laden soy sauce - just add enough for a little more flavor. My favorite use it to use it as an instant salad - just add water! Place a cup or two of wakame in a bowl, and add 2 volumes of ice cold water. Place it in the fridge, drain the next day, and you've got instant salad to last the whole week. I add thin shredded daikon, carrots, cilantro, and whatever meat I have on hand: frozen shrimp, leftover chicken, canned salmon, even taco meat that didn't make it into shells. Add a sauce made of soy or ponzu with a little rice vinegar, fresh ginger juice if you have it, and a little splash of sesame oil. Top with toasted sesame seeds and you've got an awesome seaweed salad that costs pennies to make, has flavor for days, and very little calories. This bag might seem enormous when you first get it, but once you discover its many uses, you'll use it up faster than you ever thought possible - I go through 3-4 bags a year.<br /><br />More wakame trivia: don't worry about depleting the world's supply, as wild wakame is considered one of the top 100 invasive plants, and has even established itself in San Francisco Bay. Wakame also contains the chemical fucoxanthin, which Japanese scientists claim can enhance fat burning - this may be true or not, but given its low caloric content, it'd be hard to get fat eating this stuff anyway.
