review/summary: My dog Sashie loves this supplement w/ her dry food!
review/text: I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: My fussy eater loves this
review/text: My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.  I recently tried Wellness kibble and wet foods and she likes them all, but she particularly LOVES the 95-Percent canned toppers and WOLFS her kibble down with this product mixed in.  Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

It's a great deal buying from amazon compared to buying it at a pet store.<br /><br />The only down side is this food does dry up after leaving it out for 5-10 minutes.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long.

review/text: It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products.

review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!

I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

review/summary: Fresh Oat Bran
review/text: This item was back-ordered and arrived delightfully fresh. Like oatmeal it's bland and can handle spices like cinnamon and nutmeg very well. It's nuttier in flavor and grittier in texture than oatmeal. I grew up with this as a hot cereal, in muffins, cakes, breads and pancakes; you know back in the day when people really cooked from scratch :). Doing more cooking at home, not all from scratch, has me replicating Mom's influence in the kitchen. The goal is to eat more healthily with known ingredients. Some people sprinkle it on vegetables, salads and yogurt for texture. It's difficult to find just Oat Bran, it's usually blended with wheat or flavored for kids.<br /><br />I recently found oat bran is essential for all phases of the DUKAN DIET <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887960">The Dukan Diet: 2 Steps to Lose the Weight, 2 Steps to Keep It Off Forever</a>  ranging from 2 - 4 Tablespoons daily.<br /><br />As you add oat bran and oat bran items to your menu increase the water intake, your tummy will appreciate it :)

review/text: We use oat bran in muffins, pancakes, bread and a few other home made treats.  It's great to get 12 pounds of the stuff delivered all at once and a lot cheaper than buying it in one pound boxes in the grocery store.  How do they do it?

review/summary: Oat Bran at its best
review/text: I went on the Dr Dukan diet(which by the way is really a good fast acting diet if followed)and the diet includes eating two tablespoons of oat bran every single day.  So I ordered the Bergin Nut Oat Bran as recommended by Amazon and I would rate it with 5 stars.  I only have two recipes to date from Dr Dukan, one being a pancake and one hot cereal, but they are both delicious and I am sure it is because of the freshness and quality of the Bergin Nut Company Oat Bran.<br />My only complaint is the quantity I ordered and cannot blame anyone but myself for not reading the ad better. Six 32 ounce bags would last me an eternity at 2 tablespoons a day, so I have been giving bags to my friends and hope they will share some new recipes with me.  Try it, you will LOVE it!!!

review/summary: Amazing Oat Bran, Necessary Ingredient for Success in Dukan Diet
review/text: This is a wonderful product my husband and I are using in conjunction with the Dukan Diet.  My husband has lost 27 lbs and I have lost 12lbs since 23 May 20011 when we started the diet.  We simply put the required amount of oat bran in 0% fat vanilla yogurt and eat it as at treat.  Reminds us of tapioca, and is a necessary part of success in this diet plan. We've just opened our second box of oat bran and are starting our 9th week.  We will continue to purchase and use this product.

review/text: This is a good quality oat bran in my opinion.  It is very fresh and has a great texture.  You get a whole lot of product for your money.  I put it on my yogurt in the morning.  I have to find other recipes for this because it's too large of a quantity to use just a couple tablespoons per day.

review/summary: Bran reasonably priced
review/text: I mix oat bran with my morning cereal. Up until a year ago I bought the Giant store brand. Then it disappeared, so I forced to "upgrade" to Quaker Oats bran at at a premium price. Then in January the contents of the  Quacker box was reduced by 50%, but the price stayed the same. Enough is enough.  Switched to buying from Bergin Nut Company via amazon. The quantity is huge but the price per pound is very reasonable - and it shipped via Amazon Prime. The bran is coarser than the Quaker label. (That's a good thing?) All in all, I am very pleased.

It tastes much better to me than any other type of regular oats I've had before. It is very affordable and delivered right to my house. I will be eating this product alot more in the future. It is a great quality product and it is packaged well for the trip in the box. I am very happy with this product and will order more.

review/summary: Great tasting, healthy, and inexpensive.
review/text: I don't believe in fad diets, but I do believe in healthy eating. This is a cheap, healthy alternative to boxed cereals and high-carb/fat breakfasts.<br /><br />My first choice is always steel-cut oats, but they take a while to cook. This only takes 3 minutes in the microwave and tastes delicious. I like to add a scoop of protein powder & a bit of agave syrup and I'm full for hours. My cholesterol is the best it's been in my life and I even lost a few pounds since I started having oats for breakfast. You can eat it plain or add fruit to it to have some variety without negating its health benefits.<br /><br />Keep these in your pantry and you won't have any excuse for not eating healthy.<br /><br />Update: My wife "hates oats", but after looking for an alternative to her cereal to lose weight she tried my oat bran (I've also started adding a little Bergin wheat bran to it) and she loves it. I think she now eats more than I do and I've had to increase my ordering frequency.<br /><br />Plain anything can get boring quickly, but oats can be spiced up with nuts, jellies, yogurt, raisins, etc. There's almost no end to the variety. If you think oats are bland, you may have to look around for ideas, but there's no reason to resort to Fruit Loops  :)

review/summary: Great oat bran flavor
review/text: I purchased this oat bran because of the other product reviews that said it had the best flavor. I was looking for a bulk oat bran to make my home made granola recipe. I can now confirm packaging complaints have been resolved. I purchased this via my Amazon Prime and it arrived sealed in a second plastic bag inside a cardboard box. None of the oat bran bags were damaged in shipping so packaging complaints have been fixed.<br /><br />As for flavor it appears to have great oat bran flavor because the batch of granola I made was my best ever. I added this to my Wish List for shopping of repeatable grocery products so I will be back again to purchase this item. Excellent value, fast shipping, and great taste. Bergin Nut Co has a new customer.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I was a little hesitant about ordering this product as I had seen a few of the reviews mention flimsy packaging and older/dated versions of the product.  But, my food co-op stopped carrying oat bran in their bulk section and the stuff at the grocery store is prohibitively expensive, so online shopping it is!  When it arrived, I found the packaging to be just fine--no spilling or ripping, and I have been able to use the original packaging as the default storage container with no problems.<br /><br />As far as taste, it tastes like any other oat bran I've tried.  Which is to say, it's pretty bland, and a good vehicle for other tastes. I like to add nuts, chopped apples, and a bit of cinnamon to mine.  I haven't noticed any bad taste or aftertaste.<br /><br />Will probably buy again when this supply runs out!

review/summary: Good Value, Healthy & Simple
review/text: This is basic, simple, Oat Bran.  There isn't a lot of packaging hype; what you see in the picture is what you get.  Better than oatmeal, the oat bran cooks up in about three minutes.  Ratio is 1 part oat bran to 4 parts water.  The cereal is ready as soon as it is warm; no need to simmer. Easier still to microwave.  The consistency is very creamy, similar to "cream of wheat," but healthier.  Add dried fruit, nuts, honey, its a quick and healthy way to start the day.<br /><br />The package came quickly; the bags have a re-closeable seal, but recommend putting the bran in a new zip loc baggie or other container.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I was worried that being such a healthy thing to eat that this stuff would taste bad.  I actually like it a lot.  For my microwave, I mix 1/3 cup of the stuff with 1 cup of water and heat it on high for 1 min 40 seconds to get it to just under boiling temp (hot but not boiling).  Then I let it stand covered for a couple of minutes.  Just have to figure out the appropriate time for your particular microwave, since some are more powerful than others.  After that, I add some stevia, cinnamon, and sometimes other things, and it's a pretty good little meal to tide me over in between my bigger meals.  Definitely glad I bought this, and I will definitely continue to buy more.<br /><br />As a note, if you do find yourself eating a lot of cinnamon everyday, it might be of interest to buy ceylon cinnamon, instead of the less expensive cassia cinnamon routinely found in most grocery stores.  From what I have read, the less expensive cassia cinnamon is high in a compound called coumarin, which can be toxic if you eat it a lot.  Just figured I'd mention it, since I eat a lot of cinnamon lately.

review/summary: soon to expire date
review/text: I ordered this product to compare it to the other Oat Bran in taste and freshness which I have been fairly satisfied with.  Well, let me save others from making the same mistake I did.  I received the 32-ounce Bags (pack of 6) with a freshness expiration date in 4 months.  I was very disappointed with the fact that I cannot consume even 1/3 of the order in that expiration time frame.  The quality of the Oat Bran Taste does not measure up to what I have been ordering.  Also, in the same order, I also received another Brand of Oat Bran which has an expiration date of 18 months away.  The taste is the best of any I have tried.  I will give that product a review with 5 stars.  For the money, freshness and taste, I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: I LOVE This Tea
review/text: I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />This is easily one of my favorite teas and one I continually grab for to blend with others. It does have some black tea in it, so it's not completely caffeine free like mint herbal teas, but it seems to be a very small tea to mint ratio. The black tea flavor is also very light compared to the mints, and the lemon grass is a welcome note. There's also a natural sweetness to the tea that is very pleasant.

I never see it out here in Tucson.  One place carried it for a while and then stopped.  I've asked various grocers if they could order it for me by the case, but they said no.<br /><br />Add a can of chopped clams to this and some more boiled potatoes & carrots, maybe a bay leaf and some tabasco & it is as good as it gets short of all out home-made.

review/summary: y so minty?
review/text: When I read the reviews for this gum, I chose to believe the people who said the gum doesn't have a mint flavor. Perhaps that was a bad idea. Chewing the gum, I have found the flavor to be a bit inconsistent from piece to piece. Some will taste pretty good with barely a hint of mint, others will full on assault my taste buds with a horrific menthol sneak attack. The licorice flavor itself isn't very strong and doesn't last very long. It's pretty much through after about 10-20 minutes, leaving only the atrocious menthol flavor. If you can't tell, I'm not a fan of menthol. I know the name Extreme Ice should have given it away, but can't help being rather disappointed by the whole thing.

Then, there is a cool icy mint flavor as well that gives your mouth full refreshment as you continue chewing the gum.  It holds its flavor and elastisity and doesn't go bad after 10 minutes like some gum does. This gum gets five stars!

review/text: quick grabbed this at a gas station mini-mart on a road trip.  instantly became my favorite gum.  could not then find it for some time.  found it here on amazon.<br /><br />tastes like the old-fashioned rich callard & bowser licorice candies that were wrapped in silver & black striped foil.  is somehow simultaneously rich & refreshing, & the flavor lasts & lasts.  the texture is wonderful once you have integrated the outer part with the inner by dent of chewing.<br /><br />i note some of the reviewers are speaking of a mint flavor being present or absent when expected or not.  i believe this can be explained by the confusing fact that this product is available in two similarly named licorice flavor choices:  the one reviewed here called "black licorice" (black box, black colored gum) & one called "licorice menthol" (red box, white colored gum) which i have not tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SAXOJ6">Gerrit's Extreme Ice Sugar Free Licorice Menthol Chewing Gum, 12-Count Packages (Pack of 36)</a>.  this confusion may also explain the reviewer who said the flavor didn't last very long - which may refer to the "licorice menthol" flavor?  they both have "extreme ice" in their names, so i think both are supposed to strike a refreshing note.<br /><br />my next favorite gum is orbit's wintermint.

review/summary: The flavor should be listed as menthol licorice
review/text: Cadbury Adams Blackjack and Xylichew Licorice are examples of what good licorice gum should be, this brand is not. The "Extreme Ice" moniker here means menthol. The flavor starts out ok, but any licorice flavor quickly disappears leaving you with unsweet mint gum rather quick. The texture is very nice, not too hard, and it never turns into a slimy mess like some gums can. If menthol licorice is your thing then this gum won't let you down.

It tastes like the stuff that used (perhaps still is) to be served on the trains in Taiwan, ROC, or in restaurants...yes, that's right, it tastes just like cheap grade commercial Chinese tea (not Chinese/Japanese Green tea, but commercial grade drinking tea such as that given out for free in restaurants like we do iced water here in USA).<br />As such it is insipid, with just a hint of flavor. It may be decaffeinated, but who knows, its flavor is so weak and flacid that one hardly cares.<br />I feel ripped off after buying this and you will too.  Do yourself a favor and avoid it.  If you want good, strong, loose leaf decaf tea buy the stuff from Taylor's of Harrogate when it is available here on Amazon.

That being said, I have served it to others having told them that it was an English breakfast tea with fruit undertones, and they loved it.

review/summary: Clean, soft hair, but too fragrant for me
review/text: I've been using this shampoo a week now. Combined with the conditioner, you are left with very silky smooth hair. The shampoo washes out cleanly and the scent is nice. However, I'm sensitive to scents and though this one doesn't give me a headache (some do), you can smell it ALL DAY. It *is* a nice clean smell, but I was surprised that the scent stayed with me all day. And all night. All the way until the next morning.<br /><br />The shampoo lathers well and rinses clean. I would almost argue that you wouldn't need conditioner.<br /><br />I was surprised that this item came in a a bubble mailer. It was crushed a little and some of the product had leaked out. Hopefully this won't be the case for future shipments of this item. I also kinda wish they both opened at the same end; the shampoo opens on the top, the conditioner on the bottom.

review/summary: Won't be buying this shampoo
review/text: I received this through the Vine Voices program and was really excited about the prospect of a shampoo that would possibly take care of my scalp too. I have super fine hair, an oily scalp at the top and a dry scalp at the base of my head...quite the combination! I was hoping the shampoo would help to take care of the dry and itchy part of my head. I don't have dandruff and don't use dandruff shampoo, though I would like something that nourishes that area.<br /><br />The product arrived in a padded envelope and a plastic bag and had leaked all over the bag. Not a good first impression. I hope that's not the method of shipment for paying customers. I'd say a good 1/4 of the bottle was lost.<br /><br />I've used the shampoo for almost a month now and I'm very disappointed. After washing and rinsing I feel like I still have a film on my hair. Again, I have really fine hair, so I definitely don't need a product meant to wash, leave a greasy film behind. It weighed down my hair and took away any shine, leaving it looking dirty. I am just not impressed.<br /><br />I noticed no difference on my scalp, so overall, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone concerned with lack of hair volume or who wants to have shiny, soft hair!

review/summary: Clean Hair, Poor Container
review/text: I was able to try the Total Care shampoo through the Vine Voice promotion. I only mention this because the method of shipping for Vine Voice promotional products is sometimes different than when the item is ordered normally, and because my only problem with the product involves the container.<br /><br />The shampoo had been slightly crushed in the mail and had opened and leaked in the bag. Normally I would tell customers to ask for a box from customer support. However, after I cleaned up the bottle there was still a problem.  The shampoo bottle is flat on the top and on the bottom. I stored the bottle upside down in my shower caddy. The flip top lid doesn't seem to hold a seal when upside down, and small amounts of shampoo seep through the edges of the top. Stored right side up this is not a problem. And I am not sure if this bottle defect is a result of the crush in the mail.<br /><br />So I am a little cautious about recommending the bottle.  I can, however, recommend the shampoo itself without hesitation.<br /><br />The shampoo has a light fragrance. It smells fresh and clean without too much perfume. It rinses clean.<br /><br />The essential oils in the shampoo also leave your hair shiney and sleek. The shampoo contains Sunflower seed oil, sweet almond oil, soybean oil, coconut oil, and aloe extract.<br /><br />I am very happy with the shampoo, but I would be a little wary of the shipping method and the bottle.
