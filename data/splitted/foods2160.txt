review/summary: Authentic Thai Fish Sauce
review/text: If you are planning on making some thai recipes at home this is the best Thai fish sauce money can buy. Add some sugar, some water, mint cilantro and chilies and you'll have a staple of Thai cooking, serve that dressing with Spring rolls, Thai noodles and even brussels sprouts and you'll have a hit! Check out my blog for a nice recipe using that stuff.

review/summary: What a discovery for the casual paella maker!
review/text: I first heard about fish sauce from Giada De Laurentiis.  She took a break from the 'Everyday Italian' to do some Thai food.  Based on what she said, it seemed that Fish Sauce could be an easy proxy substitute for Anchovies in almost any simple application.<br /><br />I personally dislike anchovies, and don't like working with them.  With that said, their particular glutamic acids are essential to the flavor certain recipes... like Cuban Paella or Puttanesca sauce.  I decided to purchase some in the hopes that I could forget about wasting half-full tins of anchovies for odd recipes I rarely make.<br /><br />Wow! This sauce is pretty spectacular.  I think it has a lot more punch and much better flavor than mere anchovies, so use sparingly, but use often.  I am now planning to try a lot of anchovy recipes that I was formerly avoiding.  No reason to avoid them now.<br /><br />Try combining this with Sesame Chili oil for a real flavor booster.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: This is much higher quality and much less expensive than the Thai Kitchen fish sauce in my local supermarket.<br />  I use it in almost everything: it enhances the fish flavor of any fish preparation or sauce to go with fish. In dishes that don't have fish in them it acts as a great flavor enhancer. I'm hooked for life! The only thing I regret is not ordering two units (total of four bottles).<br />Haven't tried cooking Thai food yet-I just use it for all my cooking.

review/summary: Indispensible for Thai cooking
review/text: Here is a common recipe that shows the possibilities of fish sauce, Chicken and Holy Basil.  This is my favorite version, there are many others.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />The proportions of ingredients are strictly to your taste.  My wife and I will use one large chicken breast, a whole bell pepper and a medium onion.  Too much chicken makes the dish too meaty for my taste, but as long as it cooks uniformly there's no right or wrong.<br /><br />1-2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into about 1" strips pieces.  I prefer all natural or organic, never frozen.  It costs more but tastes much better.  You can also add another chicken breast or two to scale up the recipe.  If you prefer, you can also cut the chicken into julienne pieces or even 1-2" cubes.  It tastes great however you do it!<br />1 bell pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips. I prefer yellow, as it's sweeter than green.  If you want more vegetables, add another pepper or more onion.  Just increase the sauce a little bit.<br />3-4 cloves of garlic sliced thin<br />1 small to medium onion cut into thin slices<br />1-2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced thin.  You can use Thai peppers or even serrano peppers if you like it more fiercely hot.  The amount of pepper controls the heat.  You can omit these if you don't have the palate for spicy.<br />1 cup fresh basil leaves.  If you can actually get Thai basil this is best, but any will do, the fresher the better.  Feel free to add extra, particularly if you are increasing the amount of chicken and vegetables.<br />Sauce (this can be doubled or tripled quite easily, to increase the amount of sauce with your dish):<br />1 tbsp black soy (in Asian specialty shops)<br />1 tbsp sugar<br />1 tbsp white vinegar<br />1/2 to 2 tbs Tiparos fish sauce - The amount you use really controls the flavor of the dish.  If you want it more authentic, use the higher amount; if you want it more tame, the smaller amount.<br /><br />Directions:<br />1.  On medium high heat, heat about 2 tbsp cooking oil in your wok until hot<br />2.  Add peppers, garlic and onion.  Saute a few minutes until they soften<br />3.  Add chicen.  Saute until almost cooked through.  If you use previously frozen chicken, or over cook at this point, the chicken will be tough.<br />4.  Add sauce and saute until chicken it is just cooked through.<br />5.  Turn off heat.  Add basil leaves, and stir until they wilt.<br />6.  Serve imediately with freshly cooked jasmine rice.

review/summary: Eyebrow Raising Funky Smell - That's when you know it's authentic
review/text: I used this for my authentic, home made Kim Chi. The first time I used it, I thought it was going to be a sweet smelling fish sauce, maybe similar to a hoisin sauce; but nope, it smells ripe and funky, similar to peeling off a sock from a foot with gangrene. Well, maybe not that bad, but it does have a fermented flesh smell - and trust me, it isn't sweet.<br /><br />I thought it was going to ruin my Kim Chi, and to be honest with you, when I tasted the Kim Chi right after I made it, it did seem to ruin it. But after two days of fermenting with the spices and the cabbage, the Kim Chi turned out to be phenomenal. I've never made such authentic, yummy Kim Chi in my life! Whatever it is, this sauce did the trick. The ingredients seem to be pure with no added icky stuff, however, the cheap plastic container made me worry about BPA. But that's how most asian ingredients are packaged. Overall, I am happy I purchased this off Amazon.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I am the primary cook in our home and have developed a taste for Thai food during my business travels.  No local restaurants fill this niche so I researched some recipes and found a few that looked good - but they required fish sauce (among other hard to find ingredients).  Ordered this from Amazon and although I have no basis for saying whether this is a good or bad quality product, the recipes turned out top notch.  Greatly exceeded my expectations.  Although this fish sauce was only one of many ingredients, it played a part in the final menu so I will rate it as such.<br /><br />On the down side - I think it is pricey for what it is and the seller shows no mercy on shipping.  It is probably manufactured for penny's a gallon but I guess it goes back to supply and demand and where I live, there is no local supply.

Now adding to this to every food I can find including simple cooked rice. Family and friends still cannot endure it (boring white people bah) but they'll learn. I cannot believe fermented anchovies can taste so good for let's admit it does not sound appetizing at all.

review/summary: A great sipping fish sauce
review/text: While some people like to sip their fish sauce on the rocks, I prefer mine neat.  It's much more classical and brings out the sweet fermented flavor of the sauce.  I highly recommend this variety as it contains all of the fish pieces necessary to make a delicious sipping sauce.  The old bottles would have the eyes at the bottom, but they appear to have discontinued that, which is a real shame.  Still, this is the Johnny Walker Blue Label of fish sauces and it's so cheap.  Why not splurge and surprise your friends with a nice shot of this next time they come over for a party?

review/text: So glad we found a distributor on line as we have no Asian Market where we live.  My wife and I are foodies and love Asian cuisine.  Fish sauce is a staple around our house; from stir fry to soups and marinades we use it on just about everything.  The strong flavour compliments chicken, pork, beef, even seafood!  Great with vegetable dishes, too.  Combine with red miso for a fantastic wet rub on salmon and pork.  Possibilities are endless.  Think of it as Asian Worcestershire.

review/summary: Difficult to Find Locally - Then I Found This Delicious Thai Cooking Staple on Amazon!
review/text: I like to include meals from many different cultures for our family, including dishes from Vietnam, Philippines and Thailand. I'd tried several different fish sauces from the grocery store that were awful and ended up in the compost pile.<br /><br />Then I read about this brand in a Cook's Illustrated review from 2004 (yes, old, but accurate it turns out) giving Tiparos Fish Sauce their first place spot. I never could find the product locally however, then found it on Amazon, available with Prime free shipping and ordered it.<br /><br />The sauce is delicious and it is now considered one of our Asian cooking staples, along with our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016UX1E">Lee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce, 18-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>, our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002FQE1C">Kikkoman Hoisin Sauce</a> and our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LA77K">SHOYU, NAMA YAMAKI OG 5OZ</a> as well as the toasted sesame oil. While the bottles we received did not say to refrigerate after opening, we do,  just as we do our other, opened Asian sauces and oils.

review/text: THE GOOD<br /><br />* Very pungent, complex flavors. This fish sauce is like a truffle. There are so many levels of flavor of aroma. It's not just salt and fish like other brands.<br />* Anchovy-based. A sustainable fish that usually contains low levels of mercury.<br />* Very reasonably priced.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />* The plastic bottle. It's a low grade plastic and I'm no plastic composition expert but I'm suspicious of BPA. I'm sure it keeps costs down compared to glass but I wish it was a bit more eco-friendly.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />Don't even look anywhere else for fish sauce. If you've got a recipe that calls for it, Tiparos is the only one you'll ever need.

I bought some fish sauce not knowing what I was looking for and it was disgusting.  This is also really cheap and there's TONS of it.  Thanks so much.  Do NOT leave the lid open or some liquid will evaporate leaving salt crystals.  You don't want this as it doesn't taste as good afterwards, trust me.

review/summary: An Outstanding All Purpose Seasoning!!I
review/text: I have been using Magic Dust for about a year, after reading Mike Mills' book, "Peace, Love & Barbeque". Mike is, of course, the proprietor of the 17th Street Bar & Grill and the developer of the formula for Magic Dust. Mike claims that this stuff works on everything but ice cream, and he's not far off the mark. I wouldn't use it on anything in the dessert category, but I have used it on just about everything else, including veggies, soup and even scrambled eggs! Needless to say, it is great on meat, poultry and fish, whether grilled, barbequed or done in the oven.<br /><br />Shortly after getting it, I noticed that the level was dropping faster than I was using it. Turns out the the SO, who initially turned up her nose at "that barbeque stuff" had developed her own addiction to it. Mills offers this stuff in one pound bags from the 17th Street Bar & Grill site, and that's the way to buy it. As Mike says in his book, "It keeps indefinately but it won't last long!"<br /><br />Great stuff!!

review/summary: Like Beef Dipped in an Ashtray
review/text: I'm a big fan of Jack Link's beef jerky, especially their flavored jerky's. I hadn't seen this one in the stores so when it went on sale on Amazon I scooped it up. Generally the beef nuggets and tendercuts style jerky's are not my favorite, for some reason the beef gets very rubbery compared to the regular style cuts, but I knew this diving into the bag of jerky.<br /><br />At first the taste was like the beef had been dropped in a pile of debris on a smokehouse floor, smokey, meaty and ashy tasting. I thought maybe it was just the initial taste  and continued to chew. It only worsened as I continued and eventually I swallowed and was met with a disgusting taste left in my mouth.<br /><br />Now that I have all four bags remaining I'm not sure what to do with them. I may give them away as a gag gift for the holidays and literally watch people gag as they try to eat this.

review/text: It's hard to judge this stuff as jerky, really, since it doesn't have a lot of "jerk" - they're little strips about the size and shape of a french fry - perhaps three inches long, and about 3/8" square. Thanks probably to powerful industrial meat chemicals, they're incredibly tender, and make great little meat-flavored snacks. My only problem with them is that you get maybe a dozen strips per bag, and they're kinda expensive to get so little. Oh well, meat's expensive.

I do not trust in organic foods from China as of yet.<br /><br />When I contacted Eden Foods about where these sesame seeds were sourced from a year ago, they answered quickly and the country was not China.  I believe it was Mexico.<br /><br />Have been using the product to add flavor and seasoning in my soups and stir frys.  This is a great product!  My mother, who is an excellent cook, cooks with it also, and food always tastes delicious.<br /><br />Below are the organic brand labels who are now owned by huge corps.  Eden was founded in 1968 and is still independent...support them!  And no, I do not work for the company...I'm a stay at home mom.<br /><br />General Mills owns Muir Glen and Cascadian Farm<br /><br />* Heinz owns Hain, Breadshop, Arrowhead Mills, Garden of Eatin', Farm Foods, Imagine Rice (and Soy) Dream, Casbah, Health Valley, DeBoles, Nile Spice, Celestial Seasonings, Westbrae, Westsoy, Little Bear, Walnut Acres, Shari Ann's, Mountain Sun, and Millina's Finest<br /><br />* M&M-Mars owns Seeds of Change<br /><br />* Coca-Cola owns Odwalla<br /><br />* Kellogg owns Kashi, Morningstar Farms, and Sunrise Organic<br /><br />* Philip Morris/Kraft owns Boca Foods and Back to Nature<br /><br />* Tyson owns Nature's Farm Organic<br /><br />* ConAgra owns LightLife<br /><br />* Danone owns Stonyfield Farm<br /><br />* Dean owns White Wave Silk, Alta Dena, Horizon, and The Organic Cow of Vermont<br /><br />* Unilever owns Ben and Jerry's

review/summary: Use this almost everyday in my cooking! Excellent and tasty!
review/text: I took a hiatus from sesame seeds when I realized that all the sesame seeds I came across in store were from China. I contacted Eden Foods and found that their sesame seeds used in this product came from Mexico. In all honesty, I'm not sure how much better Mexico is than China, but I still feel more comfortable with these from Mexico.<br /><br />I use this over stir fry...try heating up some oil, add garlic, add some liberal tosses of this sesame seeds, and then start the cooking.  Adds great flavor.

review/summary: Flax Seed is amazing
review/text: I've recently been learning a lot about food and healthy eating habits. Learning about 'super foods' (those that contain all essential amino acids) has changed the way I eat, and more importantly, the way I feel. Flax Seed is simply amazing for your body: it contains a complete protein, fiber, has no 'bad' fat, and is easily added to things you already eat to make them even better for you. I use it on top yogurt, mixed into bread, and as part of smoothies after a workout. This 40z canister is a great bargain compared to health stores like Whole-Paycheck.<br /><br />Very worth the money.

review/summary: Superb Organic Ground Flax Seed
review/text: This flax seed is full of Omega 3, flax Oil, and is fiber full and high in lignans as it is cold milled which does not destroy the mineral and vitamin contents. You receive two containers of 40oz each and each container is about a month's supply depending on your usage. The cost is great. Flax USA's pre-ground flax uses a cold milled process which protects the flavor & extends the shelf life of flax. Does not need to be stored in refrigerator or a freezer to last. I store mine in a cool dry cabinet. It is also natural which is a must for any health conscious person. I am not sure if this flax is organic which I would perfer. I will have to check with the manufacturer.<br /><br />The flax seed is pre-ground and no grinding is necessary which makes it easy, convenient & ready to eat. It is true-cold milled which allows the flax to stay fresh longer! No trans fat. This product is a natural source of omega 3, 6, 9 - which is essential for good health. Also an excellent source of dietary fiber and pure lignans which is a powerful antioxidant. I use this flax in all my smoothies, put a teaspoonful in my juices, salads, soups, and whatever else I choose to put it on. This is great stuff and good for you. I recommend this product as it is worth it. Also helps to lower cholesterol.<br /><br />There is one thing that I do and that is to transfer my flax to large glass storage containers. I am not much into storing foods in plastic containers. Since the flax has oil in it, it might be better to transfer to glass storage jars to prevent plastic contamination of the flax seeds. better be safe than sorry. It's my thing.

review/text: 'A hazelnut is the nut of the hazel and is also known as a cob nut or filbert nut according to species. A cob is roughly spherical to oval, about 15-25 mm long and 10-15 mm in diameter, with an outer fibrous husk surrounding a smooth shell. A filbert is more elongated, being about twice as long as it is round. The nut falls out of the husk when ripe, about seven to eight months after pollination. The kernel of the seed is edible and used raw or roasted, or ground into a paste. Hazelnuts are also used for livestock feed, as are chestnuts and acorns. The seed has a thin dark brown skin, which is sometimes removed before cooking.' Wikipedia<br /><br />I bought these hazelnuts/filberts to use for a recipe, and I could not find them readily available.  My son lives in Oregon, and these nuts are known as filberts and one can see them everywhere. In the East they are more available in the winter months just before Christmas. They arrived packaged in plastic bags that were firmly sealed. I received two bags and froze one bag for future use. As reported, they are delicious used for a snack. I used them to make Hazelnut Chocolate Chip Cookies. You have not tasted a real delicious chocolate chip cookie until you have added hazelnuts.  Hazelnuts are rich in protein and unsaturated fat. Moreover, they contain significant amounts of thiamine and vitamin B6, as well as smaller amounts of other B vitamins. Hazelnuts give that extra zeal to recipes and to everyday eating.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 12-03-11<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004772PJQ">Green Mountain Coffee Hazelnut, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>

review/summary: Not worth your money.
review/text: When my Whole Foods store stopped carrying the regular 365 Organic cake mixes, I decided to try Dr. Oetker's.<br /><br />It's edible--but not good.<br /><br />The cake itself is pretty flavorless. There's no rich, decadent chocolate taste. Instead, what you get is a cheap, imitation chocolate bar flavor. The texture of the cake is not terrible--it's not too dense and not so fluffy that it crumbles.<br /><br />If you like moist cake, however, DO NOT FOLLOW THE BAKING TIMES. They are at least 10 minutes too long, so unless you want cake that doubles as a dried out sponge, definitely stay by the oven to find the right time.<br /><br />Overall, this product is not worth the money.<br /><br />Will not buy again.

review/text: This mildly spicy baby corn and spring onion soup is a pleasant change from bland canned soups.  The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The flavor of ginger is discernible.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I make it mostly as directed but substitute about 4 oz. of milk for some of the water and add a few leftover or frozen vegetables to the pot.<br /><br />Ingredients:  baby corn, edible starch, milk, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, spring onion, salt, onion, butter, sugar, ginger, garlic, cumin, and malic acid.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains milk and butter.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup.  Note that the nutrition information is for 5 servings per container, which would be a little over half a cup per serving which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 40<br />Calories from fat 10<br />Total fat 1g<br />Saturated fat 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol less than 0mg (!)<br />Sodium 850mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars less than 1g<br />Protein less than 1g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains over 4g of sodium.

The instructions for use say you have to drink one bottle before each major meal, but I drink half a bottle 1 hour before lunch and then the other half one hour before dinner and its working great. Some people might need a higher dosage. Its an expensive product but so worth it, at least while you're trying to lose weight.

review/summary: Curbs Appetite, But the Rest Is Unclear
review/text: I purchased NEURO TRIM on a whim. Lately I've been interested in trying different energy drinks, supplement drinks, beverages that claim to aid in weight loss, etc. I was intrigued by the bottle's shape, the purple color of the container, and the unique cap. Per the instructions on the bottle, I didn't consume the beverage until about an hour before dinner. I had been rather hungry that day, so I was surprised that by the time dinner actually arrived, I didn't feel as hungry as I had earlier. Other than a slight sweet taste, the drink was rather tasteless. The closest thing the flavor reminds me of is a weak mixture of Kool-Aid.<br /><br />The packaging says that NEURO TRIM helps with "healthy weight loss, better digestive health, promotes healthy aging, and helps curb appetite." The drink does help with curbing appetite. However, I'm not sure if it has much impact on healthy weight loss. According to the directions, in order for that to happen, a person is supposed to drink a bottle of NEURO TRIM three times a day before each major meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). It might work because by the time you pay for all the NEURO TRIM you're supposed to be drinking, there won't be any money left over to buy any actual food.

review/summary: They Work!
review/text: I've been drinking these nightly before dinner for about 10 days now. At first I wasn't sure if they were doing anything, but after about 3 or 4 days of them, I noticed that I wasn't getting hungry very much anymore and that it didn't take as much to get me full. It sort of takes the edge off of food for me, I never get as ravenous and have a much easier time being smart about my choices and eating less. I've lost about 4 pounds in that time frame, combined with a lot of workouts and eating smart when I do eat. I like to call them my liquid willpower. The subscription is the way to go on these, as my local stores are always sold out.<br /><br />I love the Neuro drinks because they are natural and gentle. The Sonic's are awesome, they give me the boost of energy and really help me focus without feeling jittery or having a terrible crash afterwards. The Sleep's are also awesome, they really do work, but I have to drink them slowly over an hour or so, otherwise they upset my stomach a little and I usually wake up having to go to the bathroom right when I fall asleep. The Gasms are also a lot of fun. ;)

review/summary: Drinks don't help you lose weight, exercise does!
review/text: I don't think Neurotrim is meant to be a slim-shake as some reviews lead you to believe. It's an energy drink without the skakes, an appetite suppresent if you are eating right and exercising, and it hasn't had any negative side effects for me. Tastes great and gets me through the day. Also, it encourages me to keep a bottle on my desk which I refill at the water cooler so i've been drinking more water.<br />I'm so glad to have found something that doesn't give me the gitters or an upset stomach.<br />I buy it at Duane Reade in Manhattan. Though the cost at the store was less than online because of a sale, I do agree that it's too expensive for a lifelong customer commitment. But as long as it's $2.50 or less, I'll keep having a bottle a day.<br />Eating right and exercise have shrunk my wasteline...but Neurotrim makes me feel upbeat. no coffee or energy shots during teh long workday since I've been drinking it.<br /><br />"Thanks megashake"

However on this drink alone, the taste is great, but the effects only happen with a constant use, like two to three bottles a day, which raises the total cost of your desired results. I love neuro drinks but as for weight loss, stick to water and exercise, in the long run, you'll be healthier. Go out and Walk!

review/summary: Looking for Starbucks Green Tea Latte & Frappuccino?
review/text: If you're like me and LOVE Starbucks Green Tea Latte and Frappuccino, then try this Rishi Tea Sweet Matcha. Neither Tazo or Starbucks actually sells the green tea matcha powder they use to make their Green Tea Latte or Frappuccino. Why would they, if you knew you could make your own at home for considerably less. It has taken me several years now to finally find it, but this is it!!!! It comes with 3 small packs, but well worth it when you can make them in the convenience of your own home. Whether I am in the mood for a hot latte or a cold frappuccino, it is as easy as measuring the matcha green tea powder and adding it to your milk. For lattes, I simply mix it in a plastic bottle with a tight-fitting lid and shake it until it becomes nice and frothy. Then I nuke it for a minute or two and enjoy! For a frappuccino, I simply blend the milk, powder and some ice in a blender.

review/text: This is a great tasting Matcha.  I too was trying to recreate the Jamba green tea smoothie. (I read someone else was trying to recreate that one). There are no Jambas in my town except the one in the airport. So I tried my best to recreate the smoothie using this brand. I blended 1.5 tablespoons of Sweet Matcha to half a cup of plain greek yogurt, and ice and milk or water to taste. Not too bad. But I also add this to berry smoothies for a slight change in flavor. I started off trying to imitate that smoothie, but now I like the flavor of Sweet Matcha altogether. Will be trying it in the suggested recipes listed on the back of the packet.

review/summary: Outstanding green tea powder
review/text: I first bought this green tea powder at Whole Foods for $10 to make green tea ice cream.  I ended up trying it as a green tea latte and just love it!  It ends up being a little under $8/pack here, so it's definitely a good price if you like it.  It's been criticized for being too sweet, but I don't find it sweet--remember you are mixing 1 T. with a cup of milk and a bunch of ice cubes, so it will be diluted.  It also has health benefits b/c of the presence of antioxidants and phytochemicals.  It's got a grassy, fresh smell to it that I like a lot.

review/text: If you're looking for matcha to make lattes, cookies, smoothies, lemonaide, cake, ice cream, or sprinkle on top of snacks, this is it. It's sweetened with real cane sugar, and it's very sweet. Makes really good addition to home made lemonaide before adding sugar, I also like to sprinkle some on top of yogurt in the afternoon. I tried drinking it when I first got it, but it is certainly not the right grade. Of course no where on the package does it recommend drinking it. I have yet to make it, but I'm looking very forward to some yummy green tea ice cream.

review/text: I love Sprecher Root Beer and had high hopes for their Ginger Ale.  I prefer a truly dry ginger ale, which is pretty hard to find.  (GUS is my favorite so far).<br /><br />Therefore, upon seeing that Sprecher Ginger Ale has only 60 calories per 8 ounce serving, I was optimistic.  Unfortunately, while the dryness is there, and is pleasant, it's overpowered by a flavor which I can't quite figure out.  I can only describe it as 'musty', and it may have something to do with the 'hint of oak' referred to on the bottle's label. It's apparent from the first sip, and is quick to emerge and re-emerge.  Whatever it is, it overwhelms everything that is good about this ale.  It's too bad, because with it's dryness and sharp carbonation, this could be a really good brew.
