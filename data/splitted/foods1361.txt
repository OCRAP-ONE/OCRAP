review/summary: Disregard one-star review
review/text: This review is partially to share my experience, and partially to explain the first review. Azaleas bloom in early spring, one of the first plants to do so, and the one-star reviewer did not realize this. Bonsai is a hobby intended for years of enjoyment, and not as a one-time 'I sent you some flowers' type of gift. Buying it in June and expecting to send a flowery gift is impossible, and not the point of this product. I bought it for what it is, a beautiful bonsai tree that will flower next spring.<br />That being said, my plant arrived quickly, safe as you could ask, and it was fuller and bigger than the one shown. There WAS a tag that said the exact species it was, along with a pamphlet with prevalent care instructions. I couldn't be happier with my plant, I will be buying from this seller again, and I sincerely hope that the one star review will be outweighed or ignored, as it isn't a fair judgement of the product.<br /><br />More concisely, buy this tree if you want a lovely, healthy tree. Don't buy it if you expect to receive a tree in full flower in mid summer. Know what you're shopping for and this is one of the best deals out there.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON THERE IS A REASON IT IS CHEAPER HERE
review/text: We bought this for my mother-in-law who lives 9 hrs away from us and had it sent directly to her. Bad idea to trust AMAZON. She seemed as though she was happy about it but about two weeks later I asked her how she liked the flowers and she had no idea what i was talking about. Apparently, there were no flowers on this bush and she said that there is no way that it is going to have flowers this year if ever, if we were even sent the right thing i do not know cause they did not put any card or tag stating if the thing was even what it was suppose to be. Amazon did refund the money but that still doesnt make up for the horrible fact that she got a leaf tree for mothers day :( Its terrible that AMAZON doesnt even know what they are selling. DONT BUY THIS HERE UNLESS YOU WANT A LEAF TREE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

review/summary: Terrific Pick-Me-Up Tea Blend
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea Rainforest Green-Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are organic South American yerba mate blend, organic lemon myrtle, and fair trade certified Chun Mee Green Tea. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "For hundreds of years, Yerba Mate has long been a ceremonial drink of friendship, hospitality, strength, and courage to the people of the South American rainforest. This evergreen leaf is known for its pleasantly stimulating effect and for evoking a cheerful mental lucidity. We are proud to introduce this delightful tasting infusion of organic Mate with the Australian rainforests' organic Lemon Myrtle, touted as herb of the millennium for its high citral content. Organic Chun Mee green tea, skillfully hand-rolled into the eyebrow contour of its name, unfolds a subtle, plum-like sweetness to the leafy lemon piquancy of Mate and Myrtle. This energizing blend uplifts one's senses, as clarity arrives like birdsong after fresh rain." It's a nice combination of yerba mate and green tea, a terrific pick-me-up (it does contain some caffeine).<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but enjoy yerba mate and/or green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br />*****

review/summary: Very smooth bright tea without any bite
review/text: This is a fantastic alternative when you need a little pick me up to start the day. The lemon myrtle adds a refreshing bright lemon essence without the bitterness of real lemon. I like both green tea and yerba mate tea but love this blend the most. The combination brings out the best in all the flavors. There is a mild stimulant effect from caffeine from the green tea and/or mateine from the yerba mate, but it isn't like the jolt and eventual crash you get from coffee. If you forget to take out the bag after the recommended steep time, it's okay because the tea does not get bitter! It's a very smooth tea all the way around. Though it's becoming easier to find Numi teas, this variety has been difficult to find so I am happy that Amazon carries it!

review/text: I was looking for a malted milk powder like the Horlick's that I remembered as a child.  The NOW brand tastes EXACTLY the same as I remember the Horlick's Malted Milk Tablets tasting.  This malted milk dissolves easily in a little cold milk with a bit of whisking.  I have enjoyed it in milk, malts and I'll admit, eating it dry right from the spoon, it tastes just the same those yummy tablets!  I chose this malted milk on Amazon because it is considerably less expensive than Horlick's and I won't look any further!

This salt never hardens, it always stays in it's crystal form ready to crumble onto your favorite foods. They call this a "wet" salt ..... from all the other minerals in it .<br /><br />While I sometimes use it in recipes, I find it best as finishing salt just before eating . It brings out and enhances the flavor of whatever it's sprinkled to .<br /><br /> It's not Belamandil brand though, it's Marnoto on the package .<br /><br />A wonderful salt.

review/summary: You're better off buying or making different icing
review/text: This product isn't that impressive as far as taste goes. Yes, it'll do what you need it to do for drop flowers, shells, rosettes, etc. But you could just as easily buy meringue powder (dried egg whites) at the supermarket and add it to a regular can of store icing or even homemade buttercream for a much better taste. If taking a Wilton coure, they try to sell you their entire catalog of products, which would explain why this is recommended for the class. It tastes like Crisco-y vanilla. I'd be embarrassed to use this on a cake or cupcakes that I am serving to people. It's really not a pleasant taste.<br /><br />If you do want to buy this for a Wilton course or another reason, buy it at Michaels, AC Moore, or a local baking supply store. I love Amazon--really, I do. But this is listed at nearly $9.00 here. At Michaels it's less than $4.00 (use a coupon and it's a little more than half that). At a local baking supply store, it was $3.29 plus tax. I have no clue why this is so ridiculously overpriced here, and I'm annoyed I actually could have bought two or three at Michaels for the price of ONE here.

review/summary: Not a good taste
review/text: I agree with a previous reviewer that the taste of this is very Crisco-y.  The only reason I gave it two stars is for convenience.  Yes, the Wilton class will mention as many of their products as possible (which is fine, they sponsor the class, but some products are NOT good).  You just have to pick and choose which products are actually beneficial for you...and some you can buy in a different brand but the same basic product.  As for this icing, I plan to make my own once I am done using the one jar for my class.  Actually, you are supposed to make your own batch of icing for the second class session, so maybe it will taste a little better even made with Crisco.  I'm going to switch to REAL buttercream with BUTTER after the class.  You can also use the 40% or 50% off coupons in the paper or online to buy the meringue powder from one of the craft stores, which is a good deal.

I'd have a spoon here and there when I was craving something sweet, I added it to oatmeal and cream of wheat instead of Nutella... It was delicious.

review/text: This icing is average and unfortunately expensive. Wilton will insist that you bring this to your first class, ignore them and make it yourself. The Wilton recipe is all over the internet, is fairly cheap to make and is what you'll be making for your second class. This tastes fine, but is far too expensive for what you get.<br />The only way I would get it again is if it were on sale because it does give you icing of the right consistency for your first cake decorating class, if you've never made icing before.

After a friend of mine introduced me to Wilton Ready To Use Icing, I was hooked! I couldn't believe that an icing so perfect for decorating and so creamy could taste so good! In my opinion, it's not crisco-y at all compared to most recipes made with shortening. It's sweet but not too sweet to over power the flavor of the cake. Wilton hit a home run on this one!

I have to say that this company is far better priced than any I looked at for the quantity and price...at least this size was. Yes, You will wait longer than you think you should because this comes directly out of India via their slow-ass parcel post. I had forgotten about it when it came, and was pleasantly surprised when I opened it. Packaging kind of sucked, but held together with no leaks of any peppercorns.  And the product is what it says it is...the Premium Tellicherry Peppercorns that is desired by most pepper lovers...so go for it...then forget about it. If you really forget..then you'll eventually be surprised to get the package when it comes.<br />If you don't forget about it you're setting yourself up for a frustrating wait...so just order, have faith, and eventually it'll be on your dinner table when you least expect it. And you'll notice the flavor difference the first time you use it if you've never had this premium pepper before...

review/text: I was really looking forward to these candies--the description online sounded excellent, and I have been looking for another corn-syrup free, vegetarian candy in addition to the Surf Sweets ones I currently purchase. These are advertised online as "contains no high fructose corn syrup" and the list of ingredients did not contain corn syrup (they were listed as "Glucose syrup; sugar; modified corn starch; Acidulants: malic acid, citric acid; Gelling agent: Gellan; flavours; Acidity regulator: trisodium citrate; Concentrates of fruits and plants (orange, elderberry, lemon, aronia, black currant, apple, kiwi, spinach, nettle); elderberry extract; fructose; invert sugar syrup.")<br /><br />When I ripped open the first package, the first bite was amazing, but the constancy seemed to be too perfect, so I immediately checked the ingredients.  Imagine my surprise to see that the very first ingredient listed was . . . drumroll please . . . CORN SYRUP. While I know that some might argue that corn syrup and high fructose syrup are distinct, the fact remains that corn syrup was not listed on the website, and that taken along with the "no high fructose corn syrup" would imply that there was no corn syrup in the candy.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, the candies were actually pretty good, but don't think that you are getting corn syrup free candies.  Also be aware that there are 2.9 servings per package, so it's going to be 350 calories if you down the entire package (which is easy to do, as the candies are pretty big and there aren't very many per package). If you just want some good candies, go for it, but don't be misled like I was.

review/summary: Looks/Smells like People Food
review/text: Most cat foods are a blackish sludge of fish smells.  Merrick canned cat foods were a total surprise when I open the cans.  They look very much like human food.  The colors are light, (especially the chicken...it is the color of regular cooked chicken),the vegetables are brightly colored and seperate.  In other words, they apparently just dont throw everything into a blender and pulverise it into a uni-color paste.<br /><br />My cat really prefers it to the foul smelling other cat foods I was using.<br /><br />Now, the Merrick flavors that contain crab, lobster, and fish will still smell quite fishy....but it's not so pungent.<br /><br />I think Merrick has a winner here, in that they're careful in the cooking and processing of their foods, to leave them in a more appealing state.  And it's not just ME that appreciates it.  My cat prefers it also.<br /><br />And yes, I originally selected Merrick because of the quality ingrediants.  I refuse to buy the cereal fillers, sugar, and meat-waste products that are found in supermarket cat foods.

review/text: I myself am not a fan of licorice, however, I bought these for a co-worker's birthday as part of a basket I made for them, and they absolutely LOVED them.  The basket was full of goodies and this was one of their favorite things.  The price was amazing and the colors are so pretty so it made the basket look very festive.  If you are a fan of licorice then these are highly recommended.

review/summary: Good, but why the uneven split between apple and strawberry?
review/text: Nutri-Grain bars are relatively healthy snack bars that can even serve as a meal replacement if your a light eater or you eat a couple of them. I really like the apple flavor, and so I am disappointed that this box breaks down into 1/3 apple and 2/3 strawberry. It would be nice if they offered a 48 pack of just the apple flavor. I do find that easting more than one of these can be a chore as they are a bit dry, so its best to have some water on hand when you eat them. I use these when I'm hungry enough to start eating something worse for me like a candy bar or other unhealthy food. They're sort of a fill in for sugar based snacks, and for that purpose, they're perfect. I keep some in my car and in my desk. They taste ok; not fantastic, but good enough. These are NOT protein or meal replacement bars, and will NOT fill you up if you eat just one. They're a snack only. If you want something more filling, check out the South Beach Diet Protein Bars. They're a lot more filling.

review/text: I've always sworn off off Hummus.. Ground up Chick peas? Don't think so!<br /><br />I first had this hummus on a Horizon Flight to Portland from Oakland. It came in the gluten free Tapas meal. I wasn't going to even eat it, but those meals are so pricey, I wasn't going to let it go to waste. Put it on the chips and was AMAZED!!! I loved it! I was so happy with it that I was actually LOOKING forward to the flight home to have it again. I am having a hard time finding it locally and have tried to replicate it at home.. NOTHING COMPARES to Wild Garden. Any flavor is awesome... but my favorite is the sun dried Tomato! SO, Now I'm ordering online and will pay the shipping fees Just to have the flavors one more time!

review/text: I was unfamiliar with Arnott products until this purchase. I just received my order and am surprised at how good these are - indistinguishable from Carr's. The pepper flavor is just right - not too mild or strong. These are perfect for dinner parties or guests or make a great snack for yourself. I won't hesitate to order more of these or other Arnott's brand crackers. In case it matters to you, the packaging is very upscale and elegant so you won't be uncomfortable putting these out in their own packaging in front of guests.

However the price is great, they are fresh and they always arrive in good condition with no broken crackers.

review/summary: Luscious Lemon Cake Mix
review/text: This is my favorite of the Dassant mixes (and they are all pretty terrific).  Made as instructed, it is a quick and easy mix that makes a cake with a 'homemade' taste. It is also fun to experiment and make other baked goods with this mix such as cookies and bars.  For bars:  Stir together the mix, 1 egg, 1 stick of melted butter and 3/4 C finely ground nuts (if it seems very dry, mix in 2 Tbls. water or orange juice).  Press into a prepared 8 x 8 pan and bake at 325 for about 1/2 hour.  (Check at 25 minutes - use toothpick test.)  Let cool completely before cutting into bars.  They are fabulous!

One day we were out of our other barbecue sauce and tried this before going to get more. We fell in love immediately!<br /><br />I am not one for spicy foods but my husband and son are - but we ALL enjoyed it. We polished it off tonight, literally getting the last drops out of the bottle before calling it "empty". It is great as a dipping sauce in place of ketchup or barbecue sauce, or a marinade. And it didn't need a lot of sauce to add a lot of flavor.<br /><br />It is certainly something we're adding to our "top" list!

I have never had this happen with any other brand of food coloring; I only tried this one because I was told it was the best for making red - boy was I wrong!

review/text: I couldn't get this jel to set.  I tried two times to get this to work.  Directions are very simple so it couldn't have been user error.  Tried orange first...it set up about half way, but no where near firm.  Then I tried a box of strawberry and that was still liquid 1.5 hrs after making (box says it takes 40 minutes to set).  Would not recommend.

review/text: I bought this tea as a Christmas gift for a friend and business colleague who fell in love with it on a business trip (It was available in our hotel room). She's quite the tea drinker. Couldn't find in any stores and the local distributor recommended finding it on Amazon. Customer service was perfect in receiving the tea very quickly and my friends was thrilled to have 100 bags of such a yummy tea.

review/summary: PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!
review/text: Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked!

review/summary: they're alright..
review/text: My dog can be a picky eater when it comes to organic/healthy treats and he only eats these about 75% of the time i offer it to him.. i guess it depends on his mood? I actually tried them myself (i try all the treats i buy him before subjecting him to them because i will NOT feed him anything I find disgusting) and they're not too bad - tastes a bit like oatmeal. I do love how you can actually see the pieces of apples and carrots in the treats and I love how the ingredients are certified organic :)<br />btw- the little story on the back of the bag "Newman Dog Tells All!!" is hilarious!!

review/summary: A+ from picky eater
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!<br /><br />These little treats are wonderful.  I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).<br /><br />Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients.  As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took).  Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable!  The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min).  With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!<br /><br />Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him).  He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique.  This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars).  I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone.  He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats.  It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product.  If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.<br /><br />Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?

review/summary: Whats happened in Oct 2011  not 2009
review/text: Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat. I look and could only find Newmans Own Salmon&Potato treats for her to eat.Since then they come evey 2mths ,by Sub&save. Today when I opened the first package I was shocked. The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is "What Happened?" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.

review/text: This product is a win/win/win!  A healthy snack for my dog at an affordable price, and the proceeds go to charity.  Outside of the many moral reasons to buy these treats, my dog also loves them.  He rarely likes dry treats, but these are an exception.<br /><br />The treats are heart shaped and about the size of a quarter.  A couple of them are perfect for a small dog and one bag will last for several weeks.  It's really a great value.

review/text: I believe this to be a perfect dog treat and have great respect for everything that Newman's Own Organics does. Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed. I think perhaps if the 'cookies' were a little less dry and / or their excellent quality ingredients were just a little more aromatic that they would be more tempting and desired by my spoiled, but well loved dogs. If I break the cookie in half, it seems to release slightly more tasty aroma and I can almost talk the dogs into them.

review/summary: My Yorkie Loves These Treats!
review/text: I purchased these treats because they were on sale, but also because they're made in the US with safe ingredients.  My Yorkie loves duck breast jerky, but those treats are made in China, and I'm not sure I trust products from there 100% after the poisonous ingredients that were found in China-made dog food in the recent past.  Of course, I didn't expect my dog to enjoy these treats as much as the meaty duck, but he reacts the same way to these cheesey treats as the duck breast!  When I have one of these treats ready for him, his responses to commands (sit, lie down, etc.) are instantaneous - he really wants the treat!  I was concered buying 6 packs at once without first testing them, but now I'm glad I have 6 for him.  GREAT PURCHASE, and I'll be buying other Newman dog products in the future

review/summary: perfect food for my old dog :)
review/text: Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight. Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years. After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat. That may be age related as well. But the stomach upsets have stopped. And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.

review/text: It isn't easy to find packaged food for pets that I can trust.  I have been doing a lot of reading lately about what actually goes into most commercial brand pet foods, and I am appalled.  I decided to start cooking for my brood, but the puppy was going bonkers for bicuits, which was kind of freaking me out.  I never thought I'd find something on the store shelves that satisfied us both...and then, in a WalMart in Honesdale PA (where my family owns a vacation home) I saw these.  I trust Newman's Own, so I read the ingredients.  I was happy, and my dog loves them, but I couldn't seem to find them back home in NJ, so I searched Amazon, and here they were.  I am slated to get a case every other month, but I might need to up that to once a month!

review/text: I figured this would be great since Brownie loves Salmon, but he doesn't even want to touch it.  I got him the Salmon and sweet potato one. He'd rather eat regular dog food than this which is quite weird for him.  He eats everything he can get his paws on, including non edible stuff. It might be because the smell is not very strong.  When I put it up close to my nose to smell it, I barely got a light whiff of salmon. Dog treats usually have a stronger smell which makes it more tempting for dogs.

review/text: These are hard treats shaped like hearts that you can break in half if necessary. They have decent ingredients though I try not to give my dogs anything with grain, the oatmeal and barley flour is not too bad. I only give one a day as a late night snack. My Doberman likes them but she is not too picky. My picky Shar-pei will eat them but is not enthusiastic about them (he prefers Merrick sausages). Overall, these are a decent snack for dogs as long as your pet does not have dental issues, these should be okay for them.  I want to make a comment about the packaging. This is one of the few "zip-loc" type resealable bags that actually reseals without having to mess with it a bunch of times. It stays nice and tight and keeps the treats fresh.

When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium.

(I know, carrots and other veggies, but she won't eat them. She's a 9 year old rescue with terrible teeth, and set in her ways. My past puppies found baby carrots a great treat, but not this girl.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll contact the manufacturer and ask for the calorie count. But I do think it should be on the package.

review/text: Our dogs adore getting treated but one has reactions to some dog treats.  I am satisfied that these treats are healthy and they definately are enjoyed.
