review/summary: Takes me back to when I was a young Mexican boy working on the granja
review/text: Of course, back then everyone drank the good stuff. This was before the U.S. Government-sponsored sugar wars of the 1970s, leading the soft drink manufacturers to use cheaper high-fructose corn syrup instead. (+ History Lesson included below)<br /><br />It was never a taste or health decision, purely cost. Of course we now know there are other (long term) costs: HFCS probably has plenty to do with the frightening increase in obesity and diabetes in this country. (* recent Princeton study; see link in Comments)<br /><br />Coke's current U.S. offering isn't just bad FOR you. It tastes horrible, too. And despite official Coca-Cola comments to the contrary ("All of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible"), anyone who has tasted both knows the difference. The suits in Atlanta have a vested interest in protecting their bottling partners on this side of the border. Their apparent failure at the taste test table thus becomes understandable if not acceptable.<br /><br />On the other side of the border, however, Mexican Coke still uses cane sugar, which translates to pure sweetness not to mention less aftertaste. Nice heavy glass bottles add to the appeal. Find these at your local carniceria or bodega, or even by the case at some Costco or Sam's Club locations.<br /><br />REFRESCO indeed!!!<br /><br />P.S. If you are unable to find Mexican Coke locally and unwilling to pay the shipping premium here, just keep your eyes open this Spring for the special Passover Coke, which also forgoes the corn syrup for good old fashioned (and Kosher!) sugar.<br /><br />[+ History Lesson follows]<br /><br />By the late 1970s, increasing tariffs on imported sugar forced U.S. food manufacturers to develop alternative sweeteners. The answer quickly became high-fructose corn syrup, the price of which continues to be kept low through government subsidies for corn growers. Damn the taste, we know what fat Americans with dead taste buds want!

review/summary: Sugar not HFCS
review/text: Finding a cola made with real sugar in my area is quite the challenge. Anyone who thinks Coke made with High fructose corn syrup is the same as Coke made with sugar is kidding themselves. HFCS is a corn byproduct that is so refined and converted that even the food industry admits it isn't "natural".<br />I realize that soda isn't exactly a health food item, but I refuse to drink anything that has artificial ingredients such as HFCS or the poison known as "Splenda".<br />The Coca Cola conglomerate isn't doing US consumers any favors by selling their poison. It's a shame we have to purchase this product from Mexico.

review/summary: Great product but..
review/text: This price is beyond rip-off. I just went to a local cash and carry and paid 22.80 for the 24 pack 12 oz.  Tip: Shop this product a bit before you give your CC number out. As far as the argument of whether this is a better product than U.S. made, no question. Its far better in taste than the HFCS goo that is in the domestic U.S. product. This product is showing up on many retail shelves because of its fast growing popularity. The glass bottle and a cap that you actually need a bottle opener to get it open is a nice throwback. I would not be surprised to see it at your local grocery store soon.

review/summary: Good, very good.
review/text: I'm drinking one as I am writing this, i never got to experience the "original Coke" seeing as it was before my time, however i did want something that tasted better than the stuff we have now.. BTW i did not buy this on amazon, it was at my local store for 1.29 a bottle, so i figured what the heck. I liked the bottle, the thick glass, and the REAL bottle cap, used the brick on my house to open it, that impressed some people. The first sip didnt seem any different than normal coke, but as i started to focus on the flavor more, i realized that it indeed had a much better flavor. No chemical aftertaste, and it had a much better overall flavor blend, it seemed to have a warmer, more welcoming taste. It also went down much smoother than the stuff you get in this country. If you want somthing that really is a good drink, and makes you feel like you are back in the 60's, i would buy this.

review/summary: Mexican Coca-Cola (Made With Cane Sugar) Is The Absolute Best!
review/text: I buy this product at my local Costco for a much cheaper price, but if I were to ever find myself living/working in some desolate place where Amazon delivered but there was no Costco, I'd pay Amazon's full asking price for the same exact 24 bottles of Mexican Coca-Cola. It's that good.<br /><br />Now I don't even bother drinking regular soda made with high-fructose corn syrup. In a fast-food restaurant the other day, I ordered a bottle of apple juice, rather than having to endure the less than spectacular taste of American Coke made with the high-fructose corn syrup. I can't stand the taste of regular soda anymore, and if I run out of bottles of Mexican Coke in between trips to Costco, I just go without soda until I can get back to Costco.<br /><br />So I rate this product an absolute five stars.

review/summary: THOSE WERE THE DAYS, MY FRIENDS (ALMOST)
review/text: Discovered this product while browsing in an ethnic store. It has a cult following to the point of being on, of all places, FACEBOOK.<br /><br />Having my conscience battle logic (empty calories) with imagination (childhood memories), I indulge on occasion.  For the record, it is almost the best coke ever bottled.  The best was the 6oz glass bottle which I last saw in the poconos in the late 70's (egad, my generation gap is showing!). THAT was the real thing, before the dreaded "New Coke" fiasco and the company backpedaling and admitting to the soft drink's industry biggest mea culpa.<br /><br />This one is very good. How much my opinion is based on the flashbacks I have when I see the amber glass bottle versus gustatory sensation is anyone's guess.  What I find interesting is that, according to a news article, the kids don't like it, reported it is too flat.  Well, that's subjective but it also indicates they've been indoctrinated by the super-foam CO3 pumped into those over-sized plastic bottles.  For me,and I'm guessing my peers, the Mexican product has a slight effervescence that parallels  mineral waters that are carbonated by nature. Apollinaris comes to mind.<br /><br />Also, I find it amusing how refined white sugar, once a nutritional bad-boy (see SUGAR BLUES by William Dufty), is now being considered "healthy" next to HFCS. Great marketing and political ploy. It is marginally less deleterious.<br /><br />Lastly, pricing: in a convenience store in a wealthy NJ suburb: $1.79@;  At Supremo Supermarkets in urban areas: $1.29 with an occasional .99 cent promo.<br /><br />a.<br /><br />p.s. the mexican Pepsi equivelent lists "sugar and/or high fructose corn syrup.

review/summary: Absolutely the best
review/text: I am not a heavy coke drinker, but I have become increasingly fed up with the canned product.  First because of the overly sweet taste that just isn't the way it's supposed to be...and second because in spite of the best caps I could buy for the cans, the carbonation no longer lasts.  It used to, and I am suspicious of corners being cut to increase profit, as it is with the cans as opposed to the heavy and recyclable glass.<br />I didn't want to support imported goods, but I tried a bottle of the Mexican from a gourment like market, and it was outstanding, as it was supposed to taste.  I believe it is a combination of the glass bottle, the shape of the bottle, and the sugar.  They really need to go back to it and they would increase their sales.<br />I buy a bottle a week ($2) and savor it.

review/summary: Wow that's some expensive Coke. And yummy.
review/text: Infinitely better than the swill Coke offers in the USA. It's not like Coke versus Pepsi different, it's like fruit juice versus Kool Aid different. It's not that corn is cheaper than cane, it's not - it's just that a lot of our tax dollars go to subsidizing the corn industry, so you pay for it on April 15th. (And then your body and the environment pays for it....)<br /><br />I don't know if it's nostalgia or the coca or what, but other cane-sweetened colas don't always satisfy like a good Coke.<br /><br />In the Chicago area, I buy these individually for about $1.50 each; by the case averages out to about $1.10 each. Look in the Italian and Hispanic markets. Ordering this from Toy Fuzz / Amazon at the current price ($65 for 24) seems useful only if you're not in a major metropolitan area.

review/summary: A Coke is not always a Coke
review/text: I used to buy glass bottles of Coca~Cola at the Spanish speaking convenience and liquor stores around Los Angeles.  Something about it always tasted better to me; I assumed it was the glass bottles.  After buying glass bottles at my local grocery store, I eventually realized: It's not the glass, it's what's inside.  Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup is a slightly tastier sweetener.  Mexican Coke IS a little better than the regular American Coke you'd get at a vending machine or soda fountain.  I don't think all people will notice, but to me it's certainly better.  And anyway, it's what Coke originally tasted like anyway!<br /><br />I can't guarantee the same experience with everyone, since it'll be a hyped up beverage and it's human nature to try to not enjoy hyped-up things.  I came to the conclusion purely by accident and really appreciated it.  I guess my tip is to either do a blind taste test, or just forget you read this review and try a MexiCoke.<br /><br />Final advice: Coke is not a beverage; it is a dessert.  Treat it as such.

review/text: I love Coca-Cola & have for decades. Mexican Coke is it for me. I live in Chicago and can find bottles sold in stores. But I wanted to get cases which I only found at warehouse stores some times. So I purchased Mexican Coke on Amazon. The Coke came in a large box. Each bottle was individually wrapped in bubble wrap. Over that, the bottles were individually wrapped in brown paper. I don't know if the cost of 24 pack Mexican Coca-Cola is expensive because of the wrapping product, the labor cost, both, or neither. I suspected both the wrapping and labor cost drove the price up. Now that I saw how the Coke got delivered, I will avoid buying it online again but I am enjoying it.

review/summary: Coconut Flour - Think outside the box, be creative
review/text: I must say that for me Bob's Red Mill Coconut Flour has been my latest<br /><br />favorite find. Overall, I am a stickler for quality and this brand<br /><br />has that base covered.<br /><br />I have added this Coconut Flour into my smoothies with fab results.<br /><br />My intial reason for purchasing this product was not as a "sub" flour to use as baking, but rather as an easy, quick and hopefully nice tasting fiber boost. Heck, it doesn't add any sugar. Carb level is fine, fat level is fine (for my purposes).  Well, nice tasting it certainly is!<br /><br />The texture is as fine as baby powder. Blends in seamlessly to my smoothies and now I have started to add to my homemade sauces and dressings. It adds to the smooth texture & consistency, nice subtle flavor<br /><br />and for the fiber boost.<br /><br />This product does not have a "bowl you over" coconut flavor.<br /><br />In fact, when I use quite a bit of it in my smooties, it has a slight<br /><br />hint of coconut ... not even enough to register on my boyfriend's unsuspecting palette.<br /><br />Don't rely on published recipes to harness the value of this product.<br /><br />Explore and do what you want.<br /><br />NOTE about the fiber boost:  My latest research points to 35g of fiber<br /><br />being a target amount for daily consumption. I add a fiber boost here and there and it adds up

review/summary: Bought 32 Pounds
review/text: I bought 32 pounds.  Bob's Red Mill doesn't have the occasional gritty and sandy shell specks like another brand.<br /><br />Coconut flour, which is fairly mild in flavor, is gluten-free, high-fiber, and high-protein.  It naturally sweetens dishes even though it's low in carbohydrates - glycemic load of zero.  I use this versatile fiber for smoothies, pancakes, muffins, brownies, and pizza crusts.  You can also use it to thicken soups and sauces.<br /><br />Because coconut flour lacks gluten, you have to use many eggs to bind ingredients.  However, I reduce the overpowering flavor of the eggs and increase the fat (coconut oil) and fluids because the flour absorbs large amounts of moisture and dries out the products.  Blueberry coconut flour muffins taste great and mimic cornbread with a slightly fibrous texture.<br /><br />Whether you are eating low-carb, diabetic-friendly, gluten-free, or any other diet, you can still use this versatile, virtually non-allergenic coconut flour to boost your fiber intake and add variety to your dishes.  My digestive system feels much better with all this coconut flour!  I just wish that it was sold in 50-pound sacks!

My husband can tell when I've made something with coconut flour  and he likes the flavor but my kids who claim to not like coconut don't seem to notice. They gobble it up regardless. I'm also replacing half of the sugar in my recipes with xylitol which further lowers carb count and is easier on blood sugar spikes. I've never used a different brand of coconut flour so I can't compare that way. It does seem expensive but I've never had a recipe call for more than a half cup of flour which makes your purchase last a long time.

review/summary: Great alternative for those on grain free diet
review/text: I am pleased with this product as a substitute for all grains.  I am on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet to treat my celiac's disease, so I'm happy to find any substitute I can use for grain flours that will give me something to satisfy my need for something bready.  I like to experiment in the kitchen and I have made a flour using navy beans that I cook, dehydrate, and grind into a flour which I mix with coconut flour and almond flour to make a banana bread that I can cut into squares and put in the freezer for a snack when I need to satisfy my cravings.  This is a lot of work, but worth it for my health issues.<br /><br />I use egg white powder from Waltonfeed.com in place of regular eggs so that the end product of what I am baking doesn't taste too egg-y, which is a common complaint of using coconut flour.<br /><br />Because of coconut flour's high fat content, I try to lower the fat of my recipes using the bean flour and egg whites.  This also increases the protein and fiber.  BTW, the coconut flour is very high in fiber.<br /><br />Coconut flour has turned out to be a great ingredient for this celiac who is prone to blood sugar issues too.  Whatever you are baking with coconut flour will become higher in fiber and lower in glycemic index.  So far, I am very happy with it.<br /><br />You can't expect it to be a cup for cup substitute for any grain flour.  Have faith in yourself to experiment with it and make up some of your own recipes.<br /><br />Another tip:  I don't use oil in my recipes but add applesauce, mashed bananas, and blended dates to add moisture.  I also don't need to add sweeteners when I use the mashed fruits in my breads, except for a couple tablespoons of honey.<br /><br />I haven't tried this as a substitute ingredient to making yeast bread, just quick breads and crackers, but I'm just looking for something to satisfy the bready craving, so I'm very happy with the results.<br /><br />This is great for those with blood sugar issues and celiac's!

review/summary: As Good As It Gets!
review/text: I initially purchased this after reading an article in a food magazine which highlighted the high fiber content. On top of that I absolutely love Coconut and am always looking for new and exciting products for the kitchen. Of course, Coconut flour just sounds good so I simply had to give it a try. I am glad I did as its really one of the more unique flours I have ever come across. First and foremost it is absolutely wonderful in homemade smoothies, as others on here have already suggested. It has a very subtle flavor and really compliments a lot of smoothie recipes perfectly. You can really up the fiber content of your smoothie without severely effecting the overall flavor.<br /><br />Another great way to use coconut flour is with chicken or shrimp. Simply dip the chicken or shrimp in an egg bath and then coat with coconut flour. We then brush on a little more egg and sprinkle some Red Bob's Unsweetened Coconut flakes on top. We then fry using coconut oil. Its important to note that we fry at a lower temperature so as not to destroy all the nutritional value of the Coconut oil. High temperatures really kill a lot of the nutritional value of oils so I recommend cooking at lower temperatures when using oils like coconut oil or olive oil.<br /><br />We also tried coconut flour in many other recipes including my families nutball recipe. The first attempts didn't work out too well but we eventually found a good substitution ratio and the results were really quite amazing. We have also made muffins, pancakes and even english muffins. What I have learned is that Coconut flour is truly a unique flour and with a little bit of experimentation and patience, it can really be an amazing substitute for more popular flours. It is a much dryer flour and as such you will have to compensate for that in your recipes. Many times this can be countered by adding more eggs. I have found that a good starting point is a substitution of roughly 20-30%. Its also important to note that most of the fat/oil has been taken out so Coconut flour is not a good source for people looking to get coconut oil into their diet. You need to buy the meat or the oil separately if your looking to put some coconut oil into your diet. The flour itself actually goes through processes that pull the oil out.<br /><br />Bottom line - Coconut flour really is a very unique flour. It has a light flavor and can really add magic to your recipes. On top of that its absolutely loaded with fiber. Coconut flour will make a magnificent addition to your kitchen cupboard. Again all it takes is a little experimentation and a little patience and you will quickly learn just how wonderful this flour really is. I cant give this flour a higher recommendation.

review/summary: Coconut flour review
review/text: I wasn't too sure what to expect with this product and purchased it with the Cooking with Coconut Flour book by Bruce Fife.  I have made the coconut bread recipe over and over.  It tastes like a not so sweet pound cake.  It is great for breakfast plain or with honey.  It has a lot of staying power with the fiber and eggs (and yes the butter!).  I did try the pancakes but must have done something wrong because they were very flat albeit tasty.  Cooking solely with coconut flour is a totally different experience...certainly not as easy as wheat flour.  Although I can eat wheat, I do have issues with blood glucose levels slowly rising with age and the fiber in coconut flour is supposed to help with spikes.<br />I don't like having to sift the flour for each recipe so I just go ahead and sift the flour for the bread recipe with the baking powder and make seveal at a time and store in the freezer--just one less bowl to clean up when I make the bread.

review/text: I like the flour, but it is difficult to find recipes and know how to use it in conjunction with other flours. If you love to cook and are an experimental type of person, you can really have some fun with this. If you are an average cook who is interested in not having any disappointments, this is not for you. By the way, it is a very healthful alternative for people who need gluten free products.

review/summary: Another product I will not be without.
review/text: I have a love/hate relationship with wheat. I loves it, it hates me. There was a point that I went without baked goods for many years. With this company and it's products, I can now have baked goods without the bloating and tummy ache that I once had. I have found coconut flour highly digestible and it's a pretty good source of protein and fiber and it's relatively low in carbs and calories. It does not tastes like wheat. But when baked, it has a bit of the same consistency and texture. It won't bake like wheat,nor does it rise with yeast. It absorbs liquid much more and when stirring it into recipes it can clump up-so sometimes one's better off using a whisk or a handheld electric mixer.<br /><br />To make this stuff rise like other baked goods, one must use a lot of eggs and baking powder (I've been told that baking soda works, too but I haven't tried that yet.)<br /><br />Ordering via subscription visa vi Amazon saves about $3-6 a bag, depending on what grocer one is comparing the price to.<br /><br />I use roughly one bag every two weeks.<br /><br />I am athletic and I must eat in the morning (as much as I hate too). This does make it easier. Below is a recipe to assist in the use of this flour. One can make many variations of this. Substitute 1 T of Coconut Flour with 1 T of Ground Flaxseed Meal. One can use spices instead of fruit (but one must add a 2T of soy milk or almond milk as a substitute to add moisture.<br /><br />2 T of coconut flour<br />1/2 t of unsalted butter (softened)<br />1 large egg<br />1 t of baking powder<br />1 or 2 T of Splenda or Trivia (what ever one prefers-I use Splenda and the nutritional value is with that)<br />3 T of defrosted frozen blueberries<br /><br />Blend all of these ingredients together. Put in a greased coffee mug or beaker. Microwave for about 1 and 1/2 minutes. Start out with one 1 and test the top of the muffin with your finger to see if it's still to moist, if so, microwave for another 20-30 seconds. The muffin will rise and it will pop right out of the cup. It makes a really big muffin that will fill one up for hours. Also with regular sugar and wheat, I crave sugar and wheat all day long afterwards. With this muffin, I don't crave the sugar and wheat afterwards.<br /><br />I top this with regular cream cheese. I drink with a glass of unsweetened Almond Breeze milk.<br /><br />The variables are how much liquid is in the blueberries and how much one needs to microwave-dependent on the watts of the appliance. There are a few variables that one can mess with. I've used Parmesan cheese and no splenda and it's just okay. This type of flour has a bit of a sweet taste to it. For cheese "rolls" I use the tapioca flour instead.<br /><br />One can also use apple sauce and cinnamon. I personally don't fancy that. I love berries though. You can add a half a scope of whey powder and an extra egg to make is really full of protein. It makes the muffin about 350 calories and adds roughly around 20 grams of protein.<br /><br />Here's the nutritional values of the above recipe: 237 Calories, 20 Carbs, 9 Grams of protein, 7 grams of fiber.  In comparison to a Starbucks muffin 360 Calories, 59 carbs, 7 protein, 2 fiber. However the Starbucks muffin won't set well for anyone wheat intolerant.<br /><br />Here's another recipe that was in my health clubs magazine.<br /><br />4 T coconut flour<br />4 eggs<br />2 T grated ginger<br />1/2 t baking powder<br />4 cups grated carrots<br />salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />Heat frying pan with coconut oil or olive oil as you would for pancakes. Make patties thin and about 1.5" in diameter<br />brown on each side. They need to be carefully slide into the oil. They firm up after cooked.  Makes about 16 patties. The carb count is under 5 each and the calories aren't quite 35 each.<br /><br />This recipe does help take the place of starchy things like potatoes, rice or bread as a side dish. It is good, but it can be a bit dry. I've been trying to figure out a low-carb/low-calorie sauce for it. But this recipe gives you the idea of how versatile this flour can be.

review/text: This is by far the best price I've seen for Bob's Red Mill Organic Coconut Flour.  I really like the fact that it comes in 4 1 lb. packages instead of one LARGE bag; I keep an opened bag in my fridge and the rest in my freezer for longer storage.  The flour is very fine, and I've had great success with adding it to recipes for flax muffins and protein pancakes.  Using it all by itself has been somewhat less successful, but I'll keep experimenting.

review/text: Coconut flour is amazing for making delicious and easy baked goods.  I make pancakes and muffins with it. There are great recipes on the web.  It is very dense and filling, so usually only a little bit of it is needed in the recipe, balanced with a large amount of eggs, milk, and oil.<br /><br />A great gluten free flour.  However, large baked goods like a loaf of bread tend to fall apart, so for larger items it's good to use another flour mixed in.<br /><br />Great price on this product. Very pleased with my order.

review/text: Makes great coconut cinnamon cookies.  This is a drier flour, so I add a little water to the baking recipes to make it moister. It probably has a similar texture to ground chickpea flour.  But when I eat cookies made with this, I don't feel guilty - it doesn't give me the drowsy feeling I get sometimes after eating heavy carbs.  I also use Mexican or Indian sugar, the more natural ones, not white sugar.

Very glad that I bought the flour AND the book because coconut flour is difficult to experiment with as it soaks up moisture like a sponge. Turns out you need to add more fat, not water or milk, if you want the batter to be moister.

review/text: I have tried 3 recipes, so far, & cannot say I am thrilled. The first was a quick bread that didn't rise & did scorch (not sure why.) When I cut off the scorched bits, I didn't much care for the flavor of the bread. Then I tried coconut muffins with chocolate chips & dried cherries. The recipes in the book I got rely HEAVILY on eggs, & the muffins proved to be rather heavy, with a pronounced eggy flavor. My third attempt was peanut butter cookies. Normal peanut butter cookies tend to disappear rather quickly around here, but these are loitering in the cookie jar. This may be an acceptable substitute for folks with wheat allergies (if the are not also allergic to eggs!), but so far, my family is unenthused. I still have plenty of flour left, & plan to work my way through the cookbook. I would like for my family to be able to experience some of the alleged health benefits of coconut flour. But my guess is that people who can tolerate wheat are not going to be bowled over by coconut flour.

review/text: This salt is perfect for finishing a dish, you want to use it on your food just before you eat it. The salt crystals are all different sizes, some big chunks and some small so when you put a little sprinkle on your salads, fish, meats, capriccios , anything, it gives your food a nice crunch that makes the taste difference from homemade food to a fancy gourmet meal. I like to always have it in my kitchen. This is not a salt you would add to something while it is cooking because the salt will disintegrate  and that is not the point of using this salt. You want to bite down on the different sized grains as you are eating.

My dog loves them - once he gets one, he wants to go outside, where he spends a few minutes tossing it into the air before he eats it.  He gets a couple each week, and they do a great job of keeping his teeth clean.<br /><br />I mentioned the smell only because, when I read earlier reviews prior to purchase, I was pretty excited because someone said they weren't smelly.  So wrong.  They stink just like you would expect a pig ear to stink, which is not in any way a good thing.  I keep them in an airtight, food-safe bin, and when I open it, the smell is enough to make me wince.

review/summary: Happy Dog, Happy Owners
review/text: I sometimes give my dog a pig ear while my husband and I eat dinner.  In the past, she finished her treat before we had taken more than four bites of food.  I gave her one of these pig ears a couple of nights ago and it lasted for our entire dinner.  These are the biggest pig ears that I have found.  Therefore, they provide a little more "busy time" for the dogs.  She loved it as well.  Also, the smell is not bad like it is for other pig ears.  I will definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Good overall, but NOT 4 pounds like it states
review/text: These are good large pig ears with 25 counts in a bag. However, the item description lists it as being 4 pounds when in reality it is (at least the one I received) 2.5 pounds. I first noticed the discrepancy when I held the bag in one hand, and immediately noticed its light weight. Sure enough, when I weighed the bag it wasn't even close to its approximate listed weight. Customer Service said I can return it if I wished, but who would actually do that when you finally receive it and your dog is waiting for it?

review/summary: Can't fully endorse, beware of problems
review/text: As an amateur home roaster I cannot fully recommend this product.  First the good, you get some nice varieties, nothing too exotic but fine nonetheless, some are even blended for espresso.  The sample packs are a bit under a lb, a decent amount for a home roaster and ideal for my behmor.  You even get some bonus mugs.  So far I've done some good roasts, but watch out for the blends.  I've had to actually throw away two of the blends without even trying to roast them.  The beans were just gnarly, especially one of the house blends, no excuse for that kind of quality control.  I hope other purchasers didn't get any packages like that.  I'm not saying never buy this product, but definitely beware, you can do a lot better.  If you're an amateur home roaster absolutely find a local commercial roaster, perhaps one with a small coffee shop.  They would be thrilled to sell you the raw beans at a decent price and suggest varieties, roasting methods.

review/summary: Quality control not so great.
review/text: I'm still using the mugs, but the coffee is long gone. Some bags were ok, others were ugly beans that had holes in them! I just plain threw away some of them. I don't know how they can sell coffee like that (although coffee of that quality is in all the commercial brands). I started ordering samplers from Sweet Maria's and have been hooked ever since. Their coffee is the highest quality and only about $5 a pound when you get a sampler.<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct is more of a commercial supplier, to be fair. Sweet Maria's is better for the gourmet home roaster.

review/summary: What a great idea!!
review/text: I'm a coffee lover, always have been and I love to "make" things. So when I read about homeroasting the first time I thought... 'sure I can spare some time for that from my wine making/ beer brewing/ home remodeling/ motorcycling and tournament fishing schedule'.<br />So where did I get: a coffee roaster, green coffee beans, and a coffee bean grinder? and... 'how would I decide what kinds to buy?<br />Amazon, of course! I read a bazillion reviews and settled on this Green Unroasted Coffee Bean Sampler and a Whirley-Pop popcorn popper, and I'm so glad I did. This sampler is a great way to familiarize oneself with the process of home roasting. I would have hesitated forever about buying green coffee beans in bulk. Vacillating endlessly over what regions beans are the 'best' to try when you're forced to buy minimum weights of 5 lbs or more or spend way more dollars for single pound packaging. I might have never actually gotten around to choosing based on an uninitiated wannabe home roasters desire to 'try' something...but HEY! Amazon has this great variety of green beans in a sampler with enough beans in each bag to get a real feel for what I like or don't and WoW! it's affordable enough that I'm sure I'll find something in the variety that will make me happy I chose to go forward with this and...if I don't? Well, I didn't spend so much getting started that I'd feel I'd wasted money ..or energy.<br />My opinion is that this is a great idea and an easy way for newly interested roasters to try many regional coffees in convenient volumes. If you are a coffee aficionado and know exactly what to expect from each regional variety buy what you like best in bulk and save even more, but if you're like me wanting to try many different varieties, I recommend this sampler. I've found that I love to roast my own. I love to share it with friends and I've already recommended it a couple times. I'll be back to buy it again as gifts for like- minded souls.

review/text: This is the best commercially available beef jerky around. It's drier than most products out there (Pemican, Jack Daniels) and much more authentic. Sadly, it seems that Trader Joe's has stopped carying it and started using their own, inferior brand. Honestly, it'g going to reduce the number of trips I make to trader joe's by 1/2. Anyway, if you like authentic beef jerkey (like the kind you used to find in the glass jars at gas stations) this is the only brand for you!

review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: I can't claim that this is the best tasting Jerky for anyone since everyone has their own opinion/tastes, but I am not afraid to admit that I buy beef Jerky anytime I see it within reach.<br /><br />Been a huge fan of beef jerky since I was a little kid since I was on plenty of road trips from New Mexico to Colorado because of family.  Jerky was the perfect snack.  From 20 years ago to now, I always have had a passion for Jerky and never surprised by any Jerky until this came around.<br /><br />Was only able to find this Jerky in my company's cafeteria.  Then they stopped carrying it and immediately looked online to find it.  Yes it might be expensive, but its totaly worth it.  Even their customer service is great because one time I got a bad package from the cafeteria and reported it on their site.  They ended up sending me 4 fresh packages (all different flavors) to make up for it.<br /><br />This is worth a try if you want something new.  Unfortunately I can't afford to get this all the time.  Maybe its a good thing because I ordered 2 orders of the Jerky (24 packages) and went through it in 3 days.

review/summary: The best beef jerky ever.
review/text: I discovered Snackmasters Beef Jerky almost 10 years ago at BJ's.  They stopped carrying it several years ago and now only stock Slim Jim and Pemmican.  I couldn't find Snackmasters anywhere and tried every other brand of jerky I could find - Jack Link's, Trader Joe's, anything I found.  Nothing compared.  Finally, for Christmas 2008, my wife got me a couple bags of Snackmasters straight from the company and I have to say, it's still the best.  It tastes like what I imagine jerky is supposed to taste like - seasoned, dried beef.  Everything else is soft and greasy; Snackmasters requires a lot of chewing and the flavor is perfect.  I'm glad Amazon is carrying it now.

The spices used are very tasty and well balanced, and the outcome is a great tasting "gourmet" product, just like the label says. Lastly, no preservatives is used. Kids would love this product because of the texture and the taste.  This is a great food find and I'm buying more at Amazon to share.

review/text: I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem.

review/summary: no lemon. not much green tea
review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Where are the flowers?
review/text: The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

review/summary: The Best Chai...
review/text: I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/summary: Superb Green Tea, Organic, Excellent!
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender.

review/summary: a bit disappointed...
review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.
