review/summary: Easy Rice Side Dish
review/text: Rice-A-Roni is a fairly easy-to-prepare, flavorful side dish. Where you need to be careful is cooking time. Not enough time and the rice is too hard. Too much cooking time and it turns to mush. The most consistent way I have found is to saute the rice & noodle mix in butter (or margarine) until the vermicelli turns a medium shade of brown (directions say "golden", but it needs more time.) Add the water and seasoning. Stir. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low to simmer for about 20 minutes. The important thing is that the liquid needs to be completely absorbed into the rice & noodles.<br />When the liquid has been absorbed, taste the mixture. The rice may still be a bit hard and need more time. Give it a few more minutes.<br />Do not reduce the amount of water from what the directions call for.

review/summary: Tastes Like Raman Noodles.......
review/text: Golden looking rice mixed with everyday spices is a popular American meal. While there is spices, and chicken health food this is not.<br />Tasting like Raman Chicken Mix one could easily use them for both products, and be difficult to tell by taste, which is which mix.<br />Fast making foods come as a huge guilty pleasure. Knowing there are ingredients that have been chemically changed leaves one with uneasy vibrations.<br />Second and third thoughts come, and you begin to wish for some homemade soup. To know each item is a sense of reassurance these processed foods often leave behind.<br />You then take a deep breath, and hope for the best outcome.

review/summary: LavAzza Qualita Rossa
review/text: I owe a Coffee Shop in one Mediterennen medevial city and have a lot of experience with various types of Coffees. LavAzza is the favorite brend of Italians (among with Illy) with a reason. It has the best Robusta type coffee ground while Illy has the best rated 100% Arabica blend. LavAzza's 100% Arabica, called Tierra, in Europe is not highly rated as the other blends, such as Grand Riserva (the best LavAzza's blend), but some robusta blend are the top on the market. In US market, Qualita Rossa is the best one I tried so far; it has 70% Arabica nd 30% Robusta ratio; with delicate flavor and creamy top (if you have a good espresso machine and knowledge of espresso making). It is good as well for Capuccino with it's 'sweety' note. Would recommend it definitely.

review/text: I bought this coffee based on all the good reviews and really wanted to like it, but I found it practically flavorless. It does have some chocolate notes, but what's missing is the coffee notes! I was hoping for rich coffee flavor and caramel sweetness, but it's bland in that department. I brew it in a Moka pot and drink my coffee with milk and sugar, so maybe this coffee would be more suitable to other brewing methods.

It does have textured grip, but if jelly gets in the threads it can be difficult to open. A easy grip lid would cater to kids and adults.

review/summary: Doesn't Taste Like Instant
review/text: I discovered this coffee 6 years ago while on a trip to Maryland where our hostess served it at breakfast. I thought it was brewed and was surprised to see the jar in her hand as she made more. I had stopped brewing coffee at home because a) finding good brew coffee is hit or miss, b) finding a good coffee maker is expensive and hit or miss, c) it's a waste of coffee when brewing for one, and d) it involves too much cleanup. Taster's Choice was just what I needed: a great tasting coffee that I could make just enough of for one and not have to clean up much of anything. A perfect storm of great taste and convenience.<br /><br />I began with the original roast (loved it but eventually needed a stronger aroma) and graduated to the Gourmet (dark) roast that they are now calling French roast. It tastes like and has the aroma of great brewed coffee. There's nothing else like it on the grocery shelves. I've tried the others and they're not even in the same class as this "instant" coffee. To call it instant is misleading. "Instant" is a pejorative in coffee world and Taster's Choice deserves better. This roast is strong, robust, and can be bitter if you use too much. If you like your coffee mild, try the Taster's Choice original blend. If you prefer robust flavor and aroma, try this blend. It's great.<br /><br />It's difficult to find this roast in my grocery stores.

review/text: I have been a coffee 'connoisseur' for years. I have gone to great trouble to find the best bean...grind it perfectly...and brew it to perfection with the perfect, spare no expense, coffee maker. All the while my mom used this INSTANT coffee (blasphemy!!) called "Taster's Choice", despite my constant ridicule. Well somewhere in a weak moment, or perhaps I was out of my Jamaican blend that day...anyway, I tried her dreaded INSTANT coffee. Well....long story short...my grinder & pot are in the garage now, and although I still have guests that politely pass on a cup of coffee when hearing that it will be INSTANT, THIS COFFEE IS PERFECT EVERY TIME, MATCHES THE TASTE, AROMA, & FLAVOR OF ANY EXPENSIVE BLEND & IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERIFFIC !!!! Thank you Taster's Choice Gourmet Roast, and please accept my apology for ever doubting my mother.

review/text: Taster's Choice Gourmet Roast is what it is.  An instant coffee.  As such, it can't taste as good as "real" coffee.  On the other hand, compared with other instant coffees, I think it does pretty well.<br /><br />Compared with the regular Taster's Choice, I think that this has a richer, bolder taste. Compared with Folger's Classic Roast (which I sometimes buy), likewise I find this product richer and better tasting.<br /><br />So, if instant coffee would suffice, then this is a product that is worth considering.  It's not the real deal, but for instant coffees, it more than holds its own.

review/summary: Great Product at a Great Price
review/text: For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as "premium" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).<br /><br />Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.<br /><br />There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.<br /><br />1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.<br /><br />2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.<br /><br />Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.<br /><br />If you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, I'd say at least give this a try.

review/text: Its a great coffee, one of the better instant coffee. The reason I am giving it 1 star is the price. I had ordered it in the last two years but price increased by 30-40% more. I would like to continue to order however needs to be competitive with what the store price is.

review/summary: Tasters French Roast Coffee, the BEST !!
review/text: Love this Taster`s Choice French Roast Instant Coffee. Will continue to by off of Amazon but the prices have gone up to be the same as my local store. So if any of you sellers who have this product read this , Please lower your price and I will contunue to buy from you . I Only drink this type of coffee. Its the best instant coffee made. It tastes like fresh brewed. So please keep your prices low so I can afford to buy this wonderful tasting coffee from you and Not the store. Its just too expenisive and I dont know why it is so much more expensive than other instant coffee but you all know the old saying." you get what you pay for". Thanks and I will keep tabs on Amazon and see if the price is lowered by any seller so I can then buy a lot of it. I would appreciate it very much. It IS the BEST instant coffee on the market. I have tryed them all and none can hold a candle to this brand. Thanks and Happy New Year to you all.

review/summary: As tasty as it is convenient.
review/text: There are those that will say no instant is good.  Then there is the group that swears *bucks is the best, probably because of the belief that "you get what you pay for".  That may be true in some cases, but I refuse to pay what Via is claiming it's worth.  All things being equal, this is a hearty, flavorful cup of coffee.<br /><br />A container lasts my wife and I approximately 2-3 weeks, and there is far less waste than we used to commit when I would brew an entire pot for the two of us, only to pour down the drain half of that later in the day.  Also, I work home care on the weekends. This allows me to take MY coffee to enjoy without having to wonder if my co-workers have either ruined the coffee pot, or used all of my products during my 5 day absence.<br /><br />In conclusion, portability, really good flavor all things considered, and a great price make this a great compromise from fresh brewed.  I ended up going with the subscription because all of our local stores discontinued this flavor, so the deal is even better with free shipping on top of the subscriber discount.

review/summary: Comes up short
review/text: I bought a jar of this stuff at my local grocery store based on the reviews I read here. It was under $10 and I like the idea of quickly brewing up a cup before I head out of the house. Well, this is a decent cup of instant coffee, and nothing else. These five star reviews must be done by NESCAF&Eacute; employees because anyone that has had a decent cup of coffee wouldn't give this so generous a rating. Compare it to Starbuck's VIA instant coffees and you'll see what I mean. If you are simply an instant coffee drinker then it will suit you fine, but don't expect any of the "French Roast" character you'll find in a regular ground coffee. I really wanted to like this coffee, but it just comes up short. Sorry.

review/text: I recently bought Taster's Choice French Roast instant for the first time because my favorite, Cafe Bustelo Mexican blend instant, has become scarce and expensive. Unfortunately this product doesn't hold a candle to Cafe Bustelo, which was so much more robust and flavorful yet smooth. I won't buy Taster's Choice again...will need to start my search over again for a flavorful instant for those mornings when I don't have time to brew.

review/text: Instant coffee is one thing, TASTER'S CHOICE is quite another.  I have tried every type of regular coffee known to mankind and none tastes as good as Taster's Choice French Roast. I have also tried other brands of instant coffee.  None compare to TASTER'S CHOICE. Many of my friends agreed once they drank coffee at my house and now they also use Taster's Choice French Roast.  Plus, having an instant coffee is more convenient, less waste, quicker to use, less mess and more economical!  I take it with me whenever I travel too! (also comes in regular formula and decaf)

review/summary: Great coffee!!
review/text: I have been using Taster's Choice French Roast coffee for probably a couple of years now.  I use instant coffee at home because it's just too much trouble and waste to make a pot of regular coffee for one person.  TC French Roast does not taste like instant coffee at all--it's great!  Granted, I am not a coffee connoisseur; I like lots of sugar and milk in my coffee.  But with the TC regular red label, it still had that "instant" taste to me.  I used to use the TC Hazelnut before they stopped making it in canisters.  I refuse to pay the extra cost for the single serve packets of the hazelnut, not to mention the waste of all that extra packaging is just offensive and unnecessary.  So I switched to French Roast, which I also love.  I only wish it were easier to find in stores.  I don't really need to buy three cans at a time, but I like Amazon's price and at least I don't have to waste time and gasoline driving around to a bunch of stores to find it.  I just hope TC doesn't stop making the French Roast in canisters too!

review/text: A wonderful addition to your morning routine. I got tired of throwing out brewed coffee. My husband and I have varying schedules and I was wasting a lot of money to brew a whole pot (sorry, a half pot just did not taste the same). This is perfect when you want a cup of coffee. I like the taste as does my husband. I'll still brew a fresh pot on the weekends and/or when we have guests but this is a great alternative for those times you want it quick. I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KDVTJI">Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle</a> to get your brew quickly.

review/summary: It is what it is
review/text: It's instant coffee.  I can't tell the difference between this "french roast" and the original - probably because I almost always add milk and splenda.<br /><br />Anyways, I like this brand better than the others I've tried.  The others tend to have some sort of off flavor that makes me squint.  This brand seems closer to fresh brewed.  It doesn't taste like properly stored, freshly ground, and well brewed coffee.  It does taste at least as good as what you get from running hot water through pre-ground coffee from a tin.  I really don't see the point of brewing the cheap stuff when the instant is at least as good and way way more convenient.

review/text: Instant coffee does not taste as good as freshly ground and brewed coffee.  Any instant coffee is a 3 star at best.  Instant coffee is only good for that moment when brewing a pot just isn't feasible or timely (or your order for fresh beans hasn't arrived).<br /><br />With that out of the way, I think Nescafe instant is one of the better instant coffees out there.  For me, it has a better taste than most in the instant class.<br /><br />Measured against other instants, I give this coffee 5 stars.  For the price I got it for, 5 stars.  For the purpose of emergency- gotta have coffee now- 5 stars.

review/summary: Smells like burned bacon, tastes horrible black
review/text: I was hoping to find an instant coffee that was as good as Starbucks Via without forking over the very high cost involved. I decided on this one and was thrilled when I read all the positive reviews here on Amazon. The first time I made it, I'd done it too strong, but eventually I found the proper strength. Unfortunately, the coffee never tasted good,and I'm shocked that anyone likes it.<br /><br />I understand that an instant coffee generally can't hold up to a fresh-brewed coffee, but this stuff isn't even close. When making it, the aroma comes across less like fresh coffee and more like a well-burnt piece of bacon. It also doesn't look exactly like coffee, with a hue that reminded me more of Diet Coke than fresh coffee.<br /><br />I don't normally drink my coffee black, preferring some flavored liquid creamer, but I do taste it before adding flavor to ensure it's the right strength, that the foundation of my morning drink is good. This stuff is extremely bitter, and that burned taste overwhelms any subtle flavors that may lie beneath. I've tried making it weaker, adding more creamer, and everything else I can think of. It's just not very good. If I were desparate, I might drink it, but just looking at it, those burnt, acrid memories come back, and I'd rather stop at a coffee shop, or grab some Starbucks Via, if I didn't have any way to make my own drip-brew.<br /><br />I read these other reviews, and I'm just baffled. This stuff barely qualifies as coffee, and as premium instant, it's a joke. I went back to making my own coffee instead of plunging further into the wilderness that is instant. And a 7 oz. canister of Taster's Choice French Roast just sits in the cupboard, with 80% of its contents remaining, waiting for the day when I just sigh and toss it into the trash.

review/text: I'm not very happy with this coffee.  It is bitter and astringent, and the aroma is odd. The aroma is harsh and smells of bitter citrus.  I got this coffee to try as a replacement for the exorbitantly overpriced Starbucks VIA Ready-brew instant coffee. The Nescafe is not nearly as good as the Starbucks instant coffee unfortunately. The Starbucks VIA is smooth, has a pleasing aroma, and tastes pretty similar to Starbucks drip coffee. It also dissolves easier than Nescafe, since it is a finely ground powder instead of crystals.<br /><br />I recommend avoiding this coffee or trying the Original blend instead of Gourmet roast. Also, regarding the other reviewers who said this coffee is not available in local stores, their reviews may be outdated or they live in weird places. This coffee is available in most of my local grocery stores.

I know there must be some agave in the product, but how much?? Now I'm worried that this might just be 23 ounces of high fructose corn syrup and the rest is agave. It does taste good. That's why I gave it a star. I don't know if I want to consume this product: buyer beware.

review/summary: A great organic sweetner
review/text: I Love Honey Tree's Agave Nectar. I know how much healthier it is than sugar or other sweeteners. I use it in my hot tea every morning, on my pancakes, in cooking and on my desserts. It's better for you since it is organic, and it's also on the glycemic index...which means your blood sugar level does spike and then drop-leaving you feeling tired. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.

review/summary: Better than average tea
review/text: My first tea from Dilmah, it has fairly typical Ceylon (Sri Lanka) flavor, but is quite a bit more robust and flavorful  than the typical mass produced black teas.  I'm guessing the grade of this tea is BOP (broken orange pekoe), not whole leaves, but a good grade or so above what you get in teabags. Still, it steeps quite quickly, and a little bit goes a long way.  It has a fresh, rich flavor, not necessarily complex, but full bodied and well balanced with a touch of acidity along with the maltiness and astringency that is typical of black teas of this kind.  It is somewhat individualistic, though, probably due to it being a single origin tea rather than a blend.  A word that comes to mind is "flavoury," sometimes applied to Sri Lankan teas.  The description on the side of the tin says it's "a medium tannin tea with pronounced woody flavours and a medium length finish."<br /><br />In steeping, I use a Teeli permanent filter to allow room for the leaves to expand, and throw away a first quick rinse of the tea before steeping a cup to drink.  Rinsing the tea makes it mellower and less astringent.  A relatively short steeping time of a minute or two is all that is necessary.<br /><br />One correction needed in the description is that there is no foil pouch in the tin, but there is an inner lid, and each tin comes individually shrink wrapped, which probably helps the tea remain fresh.  Considering how little tea you need to make a cup or pot, you get a pretty good deal here with three tins.

review/summary: A Childhood Memory
review/text: My first memory of tea was at my Grandfather's house, sitting at his table sipping tea with cream (the real thing)& sugar.  I was hooked on that wonderful flavor & later dropped the sugar & began taking it with cream or just black.  As we grow our tastes change & it seemed that I would never regain that elusive flavor that I remembered from having tea with him.<br />After many years of trying thousands of cups, I purchased Dilmah Ceylon Supreme in 2009.  At the first taste I was transported back to my Grandfathers table watching him pour cream into my cup, waiting for me to sip & asking me "How's that?"  The year was 1959.<br />Not to astringent, great flavor, so you know you are really drinking TEA, & a nice comforting aroma.  Really something I can appreciate.

review/summary: Nothing great
review/text: Single note, strong tea. No discernible citrus taste which is usually typical of high grade Ceylon tea. I think I will stick to Peet's "Buddha Peak Ceylon" loose leaf tea- now that is a great cup of Ceylon tea. Good Ceylon tea should be bright, citrusy and malty with balanced astringency.<br />None of which can be said for this tea. Overall, this an okay-ish everyday drinking tea. I am not re-ordering once I am through with my 3 boxes. Plus, calling the tea "tea leaves" is a misnomer. This is more like tea dust grade, the tea dust is so fine. That is why the fragrance/bouquet of the tea is almost non existent.

review/summary: Cool Canister insures freshness
review/text: I reviewed another Dilmah Tea as perfect for everyday use.  I would also place this tea in the category of "regular use" tea and not specialty top-o-the-line teas.  This incarnation is slightly more expensive because you are paying for the great tea tins.  Buy this kind at least once so you can transfer other teas into the well designed reusable canisters!<br /><br />This tea has a small leaf, and did not oversteep to bitter.  It has a nostalgic taste from the 1970's of pure Ceylon Tea, sadly lacking in today's tea.

The tin that it is packaged in is great the two lid design is excellent.<br />(opened a tin to day that was 1/4 full and was at least a year and a half old smelled fresh as the day I got it and it tasted great)<br /><br />It is slightly more expensive than bulk teas but it is well worth the extra 3-7$ you really get what you pay for here.<br />What ever you steep the tea in needs to have very small holes because the tea is very fine.

review/summary: Dilmah Ceylon Supreme is My Everyday Tea
review/text: This has become my everyday tea.  I have experimented with many different types of tea over the past 2 years since I became a loose tea addict.  I don't know all of the official tea drinker's lingo but I will do my best.  The Ceylon Supreme is the nicely balanced tea I was looking for for.  It is smooth but still has a light astringency or brightness to it without being bitter.  This is what I drink now instead of coffee.  It is great hot, cold or at room temperature.  I still buy and try other teas such as Oolongs and flavored teas for occasional drinking but I recommend this one for the morning brew.  I also like the metal container.  The double lid keeps the tea fresh and stays closed so that it is good for traveling.

review/summary: Go easy if you are used to teabags
review/text: This is a wonderful full bodied tea.  I will never buy teabags again.  But, having been a teabag drinker all my life, I did not realize how diluted it was until I tried loose tea.  I would recommend using much less tea than their instructions say.  I make it in a coffee maker which I use exclusively for tea and use 2 teaspoons blended with a teaspoon of blackcurrant tea per 12 cups.  Following their instructions resulted in a tea that was bitter.  Experiment till you find the proportions that suit you.  It is well worth the experimentation.<br /><br />I drink as iced tea and when drinking hot, cream perfectly complements it.

review/summary: So much easier on my babies tummy.
review/text: When we switch my daughter from nursing to eating her first solid foods we started with rice cereal.  The misery that caused will be forever emblazoned on my memory.  Colic, gas, and it backed her up right proper.<br /><br />My wife and I started researching alternatives on the Internet.  We found a bunch of references to how Barley was easier on a tummy.  That Barley soup/broth is often what is given to people recovering in hospitals etc...  I went to every local store looking for some.  Family and friends that had used it used to buy it locally.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon and bought this pack of 12 boxes.<br /><br />We found rather strongly that this was much easier on my daughters tummy.  She continued to eat without distress after we made the switch.  We started using it just as cereal and then as she got older we started using it as a thickening agent and filler when mixed with pureed vegetables etc...  She liked things better when they were less runny and we liked things better when she was happy.<br /><br />We will be ordering more here shortly for the twins that have now joined our family.  For us it worked great.  I really do recommend it as a far better option that rice cereal.

review/text: I keep Gerber 'Mixed' and 'Barley' on hand all the time. The 'mixed' consists of rice, oat and wheat so I mix a box of that with a box of the 'barley' and have a completely balanced breakfast cereal. I don't use it for people: I keep it handy for when the dogs have upset tummies and their regular food is too harsh on their digestive systems and they need soft, easy to digest food that fills them up and is healthy for them.  As their tummies return to normal, I reduce the baby cereal a bit and add in some of their normal foods and as they continue to improve, the baby cereal gets reduced while their normal foods eventually return to full bore.<br /><br />This is good for them, too, after dental cleanings/extractions, surgeries, when they need a little help in the 'bowel' department (fiber), or just as an added treat to change it up a bit in their daily diet.<br /><br />I have used this in place of bread crumbs when making a meatloaf (ok, I was desperate), but didn't care for the texture of the meatloaf once cooked. It was too soft for our liking, but still quite tasty.

review/text: I like the convenience of the packaging.  No dishes to wash either.  It has a decent amount of tiny clam pieces too.  Tastes good, but I have a few comments.  First, it takes longer than 90 seconds to microwave it.  I usually nuke it for 30 seconds, stir it, then nuke it for another 90 seconds.  It's the same with other Campbell's microwavable products like the Firehouse Chili.  I agree with the other reviewer that it's gritty.  Maybe some sand got in the shell of the clams or it has some small shell fragments?  It also has a funny smell after microwaving it.  I think the funny smell comes from the outer plastic packaging and not the soup.  The soup tastes just fine, but needs some Tabasco or a little spicing up.

review/text: I had high hope for this tea because of some previous reviews saying, "superior to anything I have tried." It's not. I prefer the one I had before this one(see my another review)<br />While it's not bad, it's no better than average sencha. What do you expect from the lowest priced tea you can find in amazon? Then again, it's a matter of taste, it can be very subjective.<br />But for the price, I'd recommend it to the future buyers.

review/text: I drink many types of Green tea, from ones that are ~$40/200g to this stuff (~ $8/200 g), and I have to say the more expensive stuff is better, I cannot deny.  That said, for the money this is a great every day drinking tea that i would recommend, and always have in my tea arsenal.  Important the water be 70 - 80 deg C, and steep for 1 - 2 minutes for best enjoyment, and no astringency.
