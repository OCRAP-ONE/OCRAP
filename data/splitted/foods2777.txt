review/summary: Yummy
review/text: It's a little to good tasting for me because I seemed to eat it all in two days even though I told myself to stop. I just couldn't. I had no self control at all because the taste was just over the top to good. They need to find a way to control peoples portions so this doesn't happen to others. Maybe some sort of time lock should be included so you could only get so much per day. Other than being way to good tasting it was fine though.

review/text: This fudge was extremely creamy and had a smooth texture (no graininess). The monks clearly know how to make fudge so that the sugar does not crystalize as the fudge is cooling. Further the chocolate flavor was everything a chocoholic could ask for. I would definitely buy this fudge again!!

review/text: One might also be surprised that this is artificially flavored mangda!  If you have a big Asian supermarket around, you should be able to find (real) mangda flavored bullion cubes.  Otherwise, this will do.<br /><br />The flavor isn't what you'd expect at all.  It's a sort of perfumy apple flavor.

review/summary: My favorite red beans and rice!!!
review/text: I admit red beans and rice is one of my favorite things to eat and this little mix produces a perfect version. A huge plus is that the mix is both economical and simple to prepare. Fixing perfect red beans and rice is as simple as boiling water with a little oil, adding the mix, and letting it simmer for twenty-five minutes. Then Voila! Perfect, yummy, delicious, mouth-watering food straight from the bayou country. Although perfect by itself, there are so many ways to jazz this simple but yummy fare up. Add sauce piquant (hot sauce), or throw in sausage (a big hit last Sunday with my dinner guests), or throw in diced tomates, chicken, pork, beef, shrimp......whatever left-overs you have in the fridge....it doesn't really matter as most things taste better mixed in with red beans and rice. So: it tastes great, is easy to prepare, it's dirt cheap, and can make you look like a culinary genius to your friends. Five stars all the way! There are different brands out there including Goya, Zatarins, Lipton, Vigo, Zatarains etc. but I think you can always safely buy the less expensive version without sacrificing any quality, but maybe you should sample the different mixes yourself and draw your own conclusions. I cover my red beans and rice with lots of hot sauce so I may be covering up some sins. If I had to pick though I generally get Vigo's if it is available. It's the one I am most used to.

review/summary: Good to mix with fresh
review/text: This pancake mix is great to use with the addition of fresh hand grated potatoes for pancakes. Aging makes ones hands tire quickly when hand grating fresh potatoes and onions for traditional pancakes, I grate fresh potatoes and when my hands get sore or tired, I just open one of these packages and add it along with an egg and about 12 ounces of water and ground pepper to the fresh grated potatoes and let sit for ten minutes. Place by heaping spoonful onto a heated oiled griddle and get ready to enjoy some great potato pancakes, serve them alongside a nice beef roast and don't forget the applesauce or sour cream for them! I haven't tried them on their own yet but the seasoning in the mix make the pancakes taste old worldly.

This is the perfect snack to have handy for that moment when you really need a bit of chocolate in your life to keep you going. If you've never tried Nutella, you're seriously missing out.

review/text: Rabbits are not to have any form of dairy, whether it be cheese, milk, yogurt, whey, casein, or anything else. Unfortunately, there are many companies out there that are only aiming to increase profits and have no knowledge about the animals they market their products for, and unsuspecting caregivers of the animals buy their products with good intentions, but end up harming their furbabies in one way or another. I've even found fish meal, yes, ground up fish, in treats for rabbits! Rabbits are herbivores! After being weaned, they survive and thrive on only plant matter.<br /><br />Take care of your bunnies and do not purchase any "Yogies" or other dairy treats for them, and ask others to do the same.

review/summary: Excellent, tart concentrated fruit juices
review/text: Excellent, tart concentrated fruit juices  4*<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the Da Frut concentrates on several counts.<br /><br />First is convenience, they can be kept on the shelf (instead of the freezer) until opened.<br /><br />Second, cost: locally, the passion fruit is the most expensive at about $3.50 / bottle -- but that mixes up to "at least" a gallon.  Other flavors run about $2, plus or minus, and make either a gallon or half gallon.<br /><br />Most important, they are unsweetened, leaving it to the customer to provide any extra sugar desired.  This is, of course, crucial for those trying to control their sugar intake, simply as calory control or because of diabetes, hyperactivity or other conditions.  But also it allows one to avoid the oversweetness of so many bottled juices on grocery store shelves, either due to the sugary apple / grape juice base or even added sweeteners.  If you choose to try any of the Da Fruta juices, I'd suggest you start with no added sugar and gradually add a few spoonfuls at a time (to that gallon or half gallon, not per serving!) until you reach your comfort zone.  I've been leaning toward the little-if-any sugar end of the spectrum lately, and find the result very refreshing and thirst quenching.  Of the two products I have in hand at the moment, the passion fruit has 2 g of sugars per serving (19 servings per container), and the cashew has 3 g of sugars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have freshly squeezed juices to compare these concentrates with, nor even any other equivalent products (such as bottled whole or frozen concentrate).  They are nothing like the heavily sweetened canned "nectars" that are available in some groceries.  Considered on their own, they are flavorful, tart and refreshing, and allow you to mix to the strength and sweetness desired.

review/text: I would like to start by saying that I have never written a review about food before. But, I must, after "tasting" this Bar Harbor Manhattan Clam Chowder... It is by FAR the WORST soup I have ever tried...I know "manhattan style" is not supposed to be thick like New England, but that isn't the problem. The problem is that this "chowder" has NO TASTE to it whatsoever..!! I didn't think it was possible, and I don't know how they could possibly remove ALL taste from their soup...but they did. I tried adding salt, pepper, tabasco, just to try to pull some kind of flavor out of this. Didn't work....needless to say, unless you like eating a soup that tastes like steam and tin, i'd AVOID this one.

At first I was disappointed, but then I tried it.  This is a wonderful soup and a great new experience from the typical clam chowder.  Unlike what I am used to this is not a creamed soup, but has the taste of tomato soup (it contains clam, clam stock, tomato, cellery, and potatoes).  Overall, I thought it was wonderful.<br /><br />I plan to try other Bar Harbor products.  It has been a LONG time since I've had a good Lobster Bisque and I think Bar Harbor can deliever.

review/text: At first I didn't like it that much because as others have noted it seemed a bit thin. But the flavor was excellent, the clam bits are copious and the real deal (not just sparse mincemeat,) and it's simply impossible to find any Manhattan-style chowder at any grocery stores here out West.  So, undaunted, I tried a few things to tailor it to my tastes, like adding thickener concoctions, noodles, etc.  Not much success.  Finally I tried flaking in a 6oz can of cheap pink salmon.  OMG, it was like I died and went to heaven.  Makes 2 servings, but the whole shebang, with the salmon, is 320 cals, so what the hey pig out it's delicious.  Canned salmon is so cheap and unbelievably good for you.  With this, it's the best chowder I ever had, and I'm going to order a pallet.  J/K.

review/text: This is my first experience with a Bar Harbor product, and I certainly hope their other products are better than this Manhattan Clam Chowder.<br /><br />Now I do not expect Manhattan Chowder to be a creamy soup like New England Chowder, but this is an extremely thin soup.  There was just a tinge of tomato flavor (I was expecting more), and the soup was also exceptionally salty and rather unpleasant overall.  The one thing it did have going for it was a decent helping of minced clams.  That said, I would definitely not purchase this product again.

I on the other hand grew up here in NY and lived several years in Manhattan having Excellent Manhattan Clam Chowder. This chowder from Maine should find a new name for their foreign product. This very nasty customer relations/quality control VP told me that "We can not tailor our products to everyone's pallet" instead of just apologizing for my disappointment in their product and offering me a coupon for something else. Bad enough the soup is awful the management is worse.

review/summary: A Good Soup. Reasonable Calories and Sodium Content.
review/text: I bought this can of Bar Harbor Manhattan Style Clam Chowder at a local grocery store. I found it in the gourmet food section rather than with the soups and decided to give it a try. It's a good soup. For a Manhattan Style Chowder, I'd like it to be a bit more tomato rich and a bit more zesty. However, the taste was quite good, the calories were reasonable and the salt was not overly high. I thought it made an excellent lunch along with a few trimmings. I'd definitely pick it up again and I'm surprised at the low ratings in some of the reviews.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I had to throw this soup away
review/text: I thought I was buying New England Clam Chowder but it was the Manhattan style. I was disappointed but figured I'd give it a try.  I had never had Manhattan style clam chowder ever before. When I opened the can I noticed right away how watery it was.  I cooked it on the stove and took a bite.  It was so bad I wondered if something was wrong with the batch.  I gave my son some of the soup and he literately spit it out. I don't know how the company can stay in business sell thing this soup.  I love all types of seafood and seafood soup but this Bar Harbor soup was uneatable.

review/summary: Great stuff, but why so expensive?
review/text: My dog and cat both love this stuff. They lick it right out of the jar, and it seems to make their coats softer and shinier. I'm hoping that it'll also help to heal a skin abrasion on my dog, and help our cat with his allergies. But, it's too soon to tell.<br /><br />That said, I gave this product four stars instead of five because it's ridiculously more expensive than seemingly-identical products that are sold by other companies. E.g., Nature's Way sells a 16oz jar for $7.99, and that product is also eligible for free shipping via Amazon Prime. So, this product costs *twice* as much for *half* the volume of the Nature's Way product, and you must also pay for shipping. Because of that, next time around, I'll buy the product from a different company.

review/summary: You get what you pay for - Best I've tried!
review/text: I've tried the other brands that were cheaper, but nothing compares to CocoTherapy Virgin Coconut Oil, not just for my pets, but for myself as well. This smells fresh and sweet and doesn't taste stale. Some other "cheaper" brands I've tried smelled like chemicals or rancid, and had a greasy bland taste. So digusting! You really get what you pay for, they are not all the "same". Just like olive oil, some olive oils cost $2.00 and you can get some bottles for $25.00. You can tell a huge difference in quality between a $2.00 bottle of olive oil and a $25.00 bottle. In the same way you can tell the difference between CocoTherapy Virgin Coconut Oil and other cheaper brands. Huge difference!! CocoTherapy is a premium, top-shelf brand. I'll stick to CocoTherapy, if you want the best, this is the brand to buy. P.S. I also love their CocoTherapy Coconut Chips, my pets are addicted to it.

review/summary: Superb quality flax seeds
review/text: I bought this item based on health reasons, reviews of the product here and all the great information on the internet about the benefits of adding flax seeds to my daily diet.  I also bought a mini coffee grinder just for this product.  At first I tried to chew it, ugh... it takes a lot of hard work, I felt like a cow chewing cud and the flavor is extremely, uh... earthy.  So instead I ground it up in my new coffee grinder and added it to yogurt, YUM... the earthy flavor is gone and a nutty wholesomeness is added to my yogurt.  I add it to everything and it makes a great addition to my healthy diet.  The seeds look fresh, clean and healthy.  They almost looked too perfect with a nice shiny shell.  The freshly ground meal smells very clean and definitely has a nice nutty bite.  There is about more or less a year on the expiration date on the package that I received.  I would recommend this specific product to anyone who wants to add a bit of health to their daily diet.  I'll more likely than not be ordering more of this stuff in the near future at the rate that I've been chowing down on it.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/summary: Really unique chips
review/text: I really like these because they are unsalted, and I love sweet potatos. They are relatively expensive however, the bags are quite small. But they are really great tasting and you can't find them in any of my local stores.

review/summary: my favorite chips
review/text: I love these chips.  I am not a potato chip eater normally, but these are delicious.  The ingredients are: sweet potatoes, beets, canola oil (or other monounsaturated oil).  Simple, wonderful and without salt or trans fats.  The taste of the sweet potatoes and beets really comes through.  The crumbs at the bottom of the bag are great for sprinkling on salads.

review/summary: Guilt-Free Pleasure
review/text: A hearty thank you to all the reviewers informing my purchase, made a few weeks back at this link from the vendor "Amazon Warehouse Deals," which, it seems, has sold out by now on this product. Rock-bottom price, unbeatable service. I second all the rave reviews on the Sweets & Beets for taste and nutrition, despite my foreboding prior to buying: I'd read the 3-star "Good & Stale" review (Too long on the shelf! These chips were stale!"). Whew. That could have happened to me. I feel for him/her, and count myself lucky on not getting hit with the same rotten deal. To the 4-star "Just a Tad Greasier Than I Would prefer" reviewer, perhaps I'd also like it lighter and drier, but who knows? Maybe the taste would suffer. To the 2-star "too salty" review, I'm mystified. The package claims 10 mg sodium, or 0% RDA of salt (per serving), and the contents passed my taste bud / lie-detector test. What on earth was dropped at your doorstep?<br /><br />To try to explain that--as well the pictured package here of crinkled chips, when I've never found them crinkled--I wrote the company. Here's their answer copied and pasted. Hope it helps.<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Dear M. Bornstein,<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us regarding our Terra Chips Sweets & Beets. We apologize for the delay in our reply and appreciate your patience. We strive to maintain the highest quality products and your satisfaction is very important to us.<br /><br />Our Terra Sweets and Beets used to be "Krinkle Cut" a couple of years ago, however they are no longer this way.<br />The online retailer must have a previous label for the product (it does have the same UPC code).<br /><br />Regarding the sodium and salt flavor, the sodium is naturally occurring and we do not add salt to the product.

review/text: I just recently found Terra Chips and have sampled quite a few.  I really like these chips because they seem to be more textured than some of the others.  I also like the more natural flavor, I can actually tell if it's a beet or a sweet potato.  I find them very satisfying and appreciate the lack of added flavors.  They are crispy, crunchy and slightly sweet... yummy!  I also got a better deal here at Amazon than if I'd bought the same amount at a local grocery store (that is if I can find them).  Enjoy!

review/text: The Terra Sweet Potato chips are a delicious all-natural snack.<br /><br />No surprises on the ingredient list, and not only do I enjoy the taste, my family does as well.<br /><br />The only thing that I could fault the chips for are that they are greasier than I would prefer. If they had a "baked" option for these chips that had similar flavor, I'd probably go for those.<br /><br />All in all, priced right, taste great. If you don't mind some light grease, awesome. In the case of these chips, I don't mind all that much.

review/summary: The spiced is very tasty, and a long lasting chip, very satisfying
review/text: Hard to call this a potato chip it is so different from the average chip. Different in very good ways. First the spiced variety tastes great. They are thick, satsifying, spices work very well with the sweet potato flavor, and the taste combination makes it seem like it was just made and fresh out of the oven.<br /><br />They also stay fresh...forever. I had an open bag at work without a bag clip and the chips were still good after a couple of weeks. Satisfying probably a lot more good stuff for you than regular potato chips. Great break from potato chips, very highly recommended.

review/summary: Tasty But "TERRA-RISES" Those With Food Sensitivities!!
review/text: I got a great deal on these but it was clearly too good to be true. The taste is terrific -- very zingy but I had a strong negative allergic reaction to something in the chips. And that's where the mystery begins. Either it's the presence of canola oil (probably GMO) or some undocumented MSG -- or both. I would hope by now that the large corporate organic food companies would find a healthier oil and leave out anything that could cause health problems. I also have celiac disease so it may be some kind of wheat variant not listed on the package. Clearly this product could be a real winner but it only made me hyperventilate (even overnight), needlessly so. Maybe Terra should take a look at Kettle's old black bean tortilla chip recipe (which was phenomenal and so healthy) and then develop something along those lines. I would buy that in a nanosecond. The verdict? Savvy consumers should avoid this product -- I would recommend Plocky's chips instead!

review/text: I realized that when I bought a bag of Terra chips at the store, I was always picking out the sweet potato chips to eat. I was very happy to find the snack size Sweet Potato chips on Amazon. The smaller size helps me with portion control as well. The taste is mildly sweet and a better alternative to regular chips although there is 13 grams of fat. Keep in mind that the sodium is only 15 grams. I just hope the kids don't try them or they'll be gone even quicker. Great buy!

review/summary: Unique flavor/smell; Explosive packaging
review/text: I am a big fan of Terra sweet potato chips for their nutrition and flavor, so I figured I would try the spiced chips. They aren't terrible, but something about the smell reminds me of body odor. I would imagine it is the cumin, so for some it might be an acquired taste.<br /><br />As for the packaging; They were delivered and left in the sun for a couple hours (we are currently having a 100+ heat wave) and 7/12 of the bags exploded in the box. I think Terra may put too much air in the bags.

review/text: We buy a ton of the Terra brand veggie chips. The Sweet Potato Spicy flavor is great. It adds a lot to the sweet potato chip that the plain ones are missing.  We won't even buy the plain ones anymore.  It is super nice to have a whole pack of 12 lying around to munch on. They came fresh and as described. I think the pricing is similar to what you can get in the grocery stores, if you can find the flavor you like.

review/text: I especially have always loved these. I always bought the larger bags at the store before.  It was too easy to eat one bag in one sitting that way. There are 3 of us plus our dogs, 1 parrot and 1 cockatiel who get one now and then too. I found out that sweet potato chewies are best and safest for dogs and birds and are sold at the Dr. Harvey's pet food site. I am ordering those for my animals now as I think they may be safer- less likely to cause choking. I am ordering some more of these , the small bags, for us now and it has been only 2 weeks.  We went through 24 bags.  Gotta have em! Oh and I was very impressed at the way these were packaged for shipping. They were insulated so well not one broken chip from shipping I guarantee! We use Amazon Prime shipping which is quick and free too.
