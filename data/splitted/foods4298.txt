review/summary: A treat fit for man's best friend.
review/text: I got these for my parents dog Mya. I thought that they would be a nice treat for my kids to give Mya when they went to visit. As expected, they were eaten very quickly. This was a nice surprise, as Mya can sometimes be picky with treats.<br /><br />Whether these are healthier, I don't know. While Mya can be picky, most dogs will eat any treat you put in front of them. So it is tough to say how good these are vs other options.<br /><br />I suppose the best thing to do is see if your four-legged friend enjoys them.

review/summary: My boy just loves these smelly things.
review/text: This is not the first doggie treat that Amazon offered me to review.  I do not offer many treats to my Pug so he doesn't get too fat.<br />But I liked that these are more healthy than the usual ones, and the price was even better than the average chew treats.<br />Personally I did not like the smell but he did,and that is all that matters. I had  just got the package in the house when he started to drive me crazy, he actually smelled it through the packaging.<br />He jumped up on my lap and wanted me to open it, and I did, the packaged was easy to open and it comes in a resalable bag.<br />He really loved these, my boy does not always eat treats and has been known to leave them on the floor.  He likes raw fruit and vegetables but he went at these hungrily<br />and finished them in no time. They are the right size for him but they did go down very quickly but he did not pester me for more so I can only assume they filled him up.<br />Now when I give him one he is very attentive and he sits politely so I will let him have it.<br />I would buy these again, I chose the medium size and that was perfect for my boy.

review/summary: Good Chew
review/text: I love that these chews aren't artificially flavored and colored and don't have any of those odd animal body parts (pig ear, cow toe whatever) that are kind of repulsive to think about. Even better, shaggy dog seems to like them, too.  I do have to admit that even after chewing this he has doggy breath, but there's no saying it wouldn't have been worse without these chews.

review/summary: Great dental treat
review/text: These dental chews are both a great treat for your dog as well supposedly helping with tartar buildup.  My dog, who is normally picky with treats, devoured these.  Being a fifty pound dog, it's also the perfect size for her -- not bulky like some rawhides (which she detests) and not too small like some treats.  One per evening was sufficient for her.<br /><br />My only knock on these is they are a bit pricey.  There are comparable products available priced a few dollars less.  If the price is reasonable to the consumer, I'd definitely recommend trying them as a healthy treat for your dog.

I had to take them away and substitute greeneies.so the dogs get them in their garage pen when I vacumn.<br /><br />a week later, I think its possible this chew gave my older sheltie a partial bowel blockage, took a day to disoovle in her gut.

review/summary: My dogs love this!
review/text: I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.  They fight to take these away from each other.  They growl when the other approaches.  It's funny to watch, and they are usually fairly good about sharing.  If Big steals from Little, Little finds Big's treat and steals it for herself.  And vice versa.  Not these.  They go to opposite ends of the house and glare balefully at t'other while they chew.  I would certainly buy these - if my local store carried them and I had a coupon and they were on sale.  I'd like both a coupon AND on sale, but for these, I might only require one; the dogs love them that much.

review/summary: love these
review/text: I get a lot of stuff from the Amazon Vine program but this is the first item that I liked so much that I added a subscription to my account for them. Freakin' LOVE these things. My golden retriever is 3 years old. She sees the vet every six months (ongoing medical issue) and each time the vet checks her teeth. She has never had to have a vet cleaning because I'm a bit compulsive about keeping her teeth clean. She normally gets a Greenie a day along with an additive in her water and regular teeth brushing. Yet there always seems to be a bit of tarter build up on her back teeth that I end up scrapping off with a scaler. After chomping down just two of these, that tartar was completely gone. The nice part is that they are much harder for her to chew than the Greenies. Even though I gave her size medium, it still took her several minutes to chew it up. (Greenies are gone within a matter of seconds) And she LOVES them. I'm pretty sure she would save a baby from a blazing inferno if she thought that is what it would take to get one. When she sees me going for the bag, she starts in with doing all the tricks she can think of. Hilarious to watch. They smell...interesting. Like mint and beef jerky? I can't put my finger on the smell exactly. It's not bad or anything. I am now getting a bag of mediums sent each month and will make it a part of her weekly dental hygiene. Very glad to have found these!

review/summary: Great for bad dog breath!
review/text: The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was a really strong minty, doggy smell. I still can't decide what it is beneath the mint, but it is potent! Whatever it is, my little Maltese had no problem with it. She quickly buried the first one in the backyard, which she only does with things she really likes. She'll recover it later, I'm sure. The next day I gave her another one which she worked on for several hours before it was gone. When she jumped in my lap later, I immediately noticed that her bad breath problem was gone...wow! And it seems to last for hours. For us this is a big plus since doggy halitosis is a big problem with her.<br /><br />Another big pro for me is that these chews contain no wheat or corn products which cause allergy problems for my dog. Treats that she actually likes that don't contain these products are hard to find.<br /><br />One other con besides the strong odor is the gassiness that occurs later. I might not have put two and two together on this had several other reviewers not mentioned it. This is not normally a problem with her, however, and since nothing else in her diet has changed, I would have to attribute it to the Zoe chews.<br /><br />Since bad breath is such a problem with our dog, I might be tempted to purchase them regularly, even if the price works out to $2 per chew (5 in a bag @ $10 per bag). I might shop around first to see if I can find a better price, though. Maybe I could make them a weekly treat instead of a daily one.

review/summary: A Dental Chew My Dog Likes
review/text: My walker hound is a very picky eater. He does not like milk bones, snausages, or most of the usual cheap dog junk food. He doesn't even like those popular greenies or any other dental chew we have tried.<br /><br />At least, we found these. He absolutely love them. Our other dog likes them too, but he likes everything.<br /><br />They do have a mild smell but it isn't unpleasant to me. The first ingredients are brown rice and quinoa so I like that these aren't made out of junk fillers like so many dog treats and chews. on the market.

review/summary: Vanilla mint?
review/text: I understand that it says vanilla mint flavor, but I also expected it to smell something like that.  To be blunt, it is funky!  All three of my dogs (two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier)seemed to think that they smelled great, so who am I to judge.  I am careful about the treats that they get because the cocker spaniels try to inhale most of them.  These actually took them a while to annihilate.  Some treats leave a sticky residue on them and the carpet, but these weren't messy.  Although they smelled funky, the smell didn't linger on their breath.  The size was excellent for my dogs.  A lot of treats that are recommended for their size tend to be much smaller.  Six came in the pack, so I waited a while before giving them the second round.  They are a bit too expensive for me to buy regularly.  If they ever go on sale I would probably stock up.  Overall a pretty good product.

review/summary: Two Paws Up
review/text: My dogs (a 20-lb. and 32-lb. terrier mixes) showed their approval by enthusiastically accepting these chews and wagged their tales eagerly for more. To be fair, they love nearly all treats, but I approve of these, as well, because of the healthful ingredients, neutral odor (at least I couldn't smell them without getting down on hands and knees to sniff), and lack of slobber-staining as the dogs (as usual) chose out area rugs to enjoy their treats. I noticed no sharp points as they chewed, and the dogs are chew-savvy enough not to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />With high quality ingredients and a high terrier approval rating, I highly recommend Zoe Anti-Oxident Dental Chew Treats.

review/summary: Smelly, but my dogs don't swallow them whole
review/text: At last, a dental chew that my one dog doesn't inhale in one bite. Altho, it does smell pretty gross -- doggie chew on steroids, proteiny smell. I didn't detect any of the vanilla mint they were talking about in the description.<br />I was pleased to see Maggie the Inhaler actually working little pieces off of these. Her chomping down entire Greenies has worried me in the past. Because if it's in her stomach whole then it's doing nothing for her teeth.<br />The smell, like many dog treats, is a little overpowering. But I'll put up with it, if it's actually helping get her teeth a little cleaner.

review/summary: 6 out of 6 Dogs love these chew bones
review/text: We have 6 big dogs here, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Walker Treeing Coonhound. These dogs go through a bunch of snacks, treats, bones and toys to say the least. I am always on the lookout for healthier snacks - especially since the Ridgebacks tend to be sensitive to corn and wheat. (oddly enough, the random squirrel doesn't phase them)I like these Zoe Dental Chew Bones - no corn, no wheat and no soy.<br /><br /> When the bag was first opened, the smell of roasted chicken wafted out - good first impression! They don't feel particularly greasy to the touch, yet clearly have a flavored coating. I passed one out to each dog and they went to their respective beds to knaw away. The Ridgebacks can burn through other brands of similar type chews within a few bites, so I expected the same thing here. They actually took about 10 minutes to finish one of these Zoe bones and not one dog walked away to see if the other dogs had something better. That was astonishing - these are hounds and they always assume someone else has something better than they were given. Meanwhile, that smell of roasted chicken has permeated the kitchen - so much so that now I want chicken for lunch! I will buy these in the future for our Heathens.

review/summary: Premium Dog Chews
review/text: My pups like these chews and can down one in just a few minutes, however, they seem to give my girls a bit of a gas problem.  Now, the pups have always farted but these treats seem to stimulated their little gas makers to go full tilt.<br /><br />As instructed, I haven't given more than one treat a day and I've skipped days and now I also know better than to give them the treats in the evening.  All I need is to have a bedroom filled with a bunch of dogs pootering all night long.<br /><br />As for the treats themselves they smell like mint and molasses to me.  They're somewhat glossy and you get 6 medium-sized 5" bones to a bag.  Pricy.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'll buy any of these "Lifestyle Treats for Dogs" in the future due to the costs and the farts but the dogs like them well enough.<br /><br />Is being a dog really a lifestyle?

review/summary: Pretty decent
review/text: (These are the medium anti-oxidant ones)<br /><br />Our dog likes these well enough.  She's not "crazy" about them, though.  She'll chew on one for a few minutes, but she won't go to town on it like she will other chews (raw hide, pig ears, etc.  So I don't think she "loves" them.<br /><br />Anyway, I broke it down a little further, as I'm sure every dog is different and some dogs might really love these.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Really nice and hard, will last a long time, take a long time for the dog to chew up.<br />- Made of quality ingredients, no corn, wheat or soy or other junk.<br />- package is nice and neat, not excessive, hard to get open, or anything like that.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- They smell really odd.  Almost like... breakfast sausage, but less appealing.  Our dog keeps her toys and 1 or 2 chews she's working on in the living room.  All the other kinds/brands she has, I can never smell them later.  But even after two days, I can still smell the thing when I walk into the living room.  Not really crazy about that, especially since she doesn't look like she'll finish one sooner than a week.<br /><br />- The price.  To me, the price seems a little high for what you get, even with the subscribe and save.<br /><br />If the smell wasn't so strong, I would probably give these 5 stars.  And our dog is still technically a puppy (lab) so perhaps she'll like them better as she gets a little older.

review/text: My dog adores these! They are more dense than the usual dog treats yet not as chewy as rawhide. Though the chew appears dark in color, the color does not rub off only to carpet while the dog is chewing--as some flavored rawshide chews do. They are high in protein, anti-oxidant, and healthy for the teeth. An 8.5 ounce package contains six bones about the size of a chicken drumstick bone.

review/summary: A treat I can feel good about
review/text: My beagles really loved these. The bones are approx. 4 inches long and kind of shaped like a real chicken bone.  When I opened the bag, I could really smell them - not really a good smell, but I guess it's something dogs like. Once they started eating them, I could smell the mint. I can't really say they are long lasting. I timed my dogs eating them and it took one 3 minutes and the other one 4 minutes.<br /><br />What I like is that these seem to be pretty good for our dogs. There are apples, carrots, chia seeds and parsley, among other natural ingredients in the bones.  There is no meat, just chicken flavor.  The price is definitely not out of line with other treats that are similar to this, such as Greenies and Healthy Edibles.  I'll probably continue to buy these.

review/summary: 4 out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: I have 4 miniature dachshunds and one is very picky about his treats. Usually he snubs treats. I usually don't buy treats like these bones, but thought they might be a good change for my pooches (especially their breath). I was completely surprised when all the dogs LOVED them. In fact, the picky one ate his and then tried stalking the girls to get their bones, too. He never does that! While I might not have bought these bones again because they are a little pricey (about $10 for 6 bones), I think now I am going to have to invest in some more seeing as they made the dogs so happy! I can't say much about the breath enhancement- it still smells pretty foul in there- but maybe they need to experience the bones a bit more before there is any breath improvement. I guess these will become a regular treat in my house since it is the first thing short of a juicy steak I have seen the dogs so excited about!

We have a 2-yo golden/Labrador retriever mix, the best dog we've ever had, and while the unusual makeup of these goodies gave him brief pause to consider, he was chowing down heartily before too long.  And the best news is, as a breath mint they affirmatively do the job!  No more doggie breath!  And it's a pleasant coincidence that Zoe (a Greek word for "life") is a family name shared by my mom and HER mom, so that's a nice touch that you don't care about but I wanted to mention to pad out this review.  Let your dog enjoy a package of these and I bet you'll be back for more!

They now did away with the superior bottled sauce and only sell this canned version. The bottled clam sauce still had the great indredients and no chemicals like MSG etc.<br /><br />Their present canned variety is horrible. The old one had ALL Olive Oil, not just a little added so that they can say it on the label. The old version did NOT have MSG and all the other chemicals that this one has. Brand Loyalty is a bad thing to fall into.<br /><br />This is NOT the Progresso Clam sauce of old. It sucks!

I you live in an area like we do, grocery store employees look at you like you have two heads when you ask for white clam sauce.  I defintely recommend this sauce! (We came from cities that had "Little Italy" sections and appreciate some good sauce.)

review/summary: Good product Small can.
review/text: Wal-mart in my area stopped selling this product, when I found it on the net I stocked up but the can is much smaller than what I was used to.  As a result the price was much higher than what I expected. I use it with shelled raw shrimp, extra garlic, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese and a bit of fresh Basil from the garden. Served over thin linguine and garnished with lemon and lime slices. Variations include white wine, lemon and lime juice and sour cream added,also angle hair pasta or thin spegetti works well. This makes a very quick elegant meal in just a few minutes. The sauce can be made before the pasta cooks. Be creative, Progresso's White Clam Sauce is a good base for many dishes.  Shrimp and clams is an unusual combination but very good if you like both.

review/text: This clam sauce is a welcome change from the usual pasta sauce.  Add a splash of white wine, a slab of butter, season to taste and pour it over your favorite pasta.  Even better, buy some fresh/frozen shrimp and bay scallops.......add them to the sauce at the end of the cooking time.  Yes, the clams are chewey.....they are supposed to be!

review/summary: Good for a canned sauce...
review/text: Lets face it , in a perfect world, everything would be made fresh, from scratch , including our clam sauce. But, it ain't a perfect world, and we don't always have the time and energy to cook from scratch. The challenge is to identify shelf-stable prepared foods that aren't a pitiful mockery of their original "made from scratch" counterparts (think Chef Boyardee Spaghetti, etc.). Progresso , although suffering a little from a recent big corporate buyout (General Foods) , still makes some pretty darn good canned soups and sauces , and this is one of them.<br /><br />This stuff is quite tasty. Not overpowered with excessive salt, for one thing. I keep a can or two in the cupboard for a quick, easy meal that actually doesn't taste like it came out of a can. Toss with hot cooked pasta and serve with a salad and some good crusty bread ... the generous sized can easily serves two hungry people .<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that many people would taste this and be very surprised to learn it was simply poured from can and heated. I suppose that is the litmus test for ANY canned food, right ?

review/summary: reduced by 1 star because i have to "doctor" this up a bit...
review/text: I have LOVED this sauce for years.  I use it pretty much as a base for the rest of the stuff i add to it.  I start by sauteeing fresh crimini mushrooms in garlic and olive oil mixed with a pat of butter.  Then a little dry white wine or even a touch of dry sherry--then some red pepper flakes for a little kick! when sauce boils i add an additonal small can of chopped clams (or baby whole; whatever's on sale), 1/2 lb of bay scallops and 1/2 pound or so of medium shrimp.  bring back to boil, cook until shrimp are done thru and add 1-2tsp of corn starch to thicken a little...voila!! a great dinner!  I serve with broccoli and garlic bread... YUM!!!

review/text: I rarely review products on Amazon even though I use Amazon very often. I felt compelled to write a review for Bear Naked with Flax because I just got done eating some and I am the 1st reviewer!<br /><br />What a wonderful product. I am very health conscious and this product meets all the criteria.  High in protein, high in fiber, whole grain, omega 3, no artificial ingredients or preservatives. It also contains blueberries which are the most healthy fruit that are widely available in stores. On top of all this health...<br /><br />This product tastes amazing mixed with Vanilla yogurt too!<br /><br />Price is a little steep in my opinion. When you have a great product and little competition, that's just how it is going to be. Would love to see a bulk purchase option at Sam's club or through Amazon.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: I picked up a roll of this at a local natural grocery store. I tend to prefer natural type products wherever possible.<br /><br />The wax of this paper is soy-based.<br /><br />The paper has a nice brown color, like the paper a butcher uses. It is not waxy feeling like the opaque whitish commercial brands. Even so, it resists absorbing moisture from what is wrapped, much better I have found than the commercial wax papers.<br /><br />Better performance, AND natural. How can you beat that?<br /><br />I would love to see a smaller SKU of this product offered by Amazon. 12 rolls of wax paper would last most of the rest of my life.

review/summary: If You Care Unbleached All Natural Waxed Paper
review/text: It's wax paper. It's made with soy wax instead of petroleum based wax. It does what you expect wax paper to do. So I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />I don't care for the packaging, which does not allow you to tear off sheets of wax paper easily. There's no strip of toothed metal or plastic to help tear off the paper -- just the edge of the cardboard, which doesn't really do the job. Unless you're in the habit of using a scissors, I suggest you do what I did and buy a wax paper dispenser to put the rolls in.<br /><br />I'd rather I didn't have to buy 12 rolls at once, but I'll get around to using them eventually.

review/text: I love brown rice. The rest of my family, not so much. So I serve this and everyone eats it happily. It has a wonderful fragrance as it cooks, and when it's done cooking, the texture is more like white rice than brown rice. It absorbs flavorings beautifully. (I use it to make my own yellow rice, which is healthier than the msg- and sodium-filled boxes in the supermarket. Comment here if you want my easy recipe.)<br /><br />There are still occasions when I want "real" brown rice, such as when I am making a brown rice salad, but mostly I reach for this one.<br /><br />When I have bought the 4-pack from Amazon (which I have several times now), the expiration date has been about a year from when I bought it.

I really wanted her to be getting more nutrients with our rice dishes. I tried this light brown rice and she didn't notice the difference. I won't purchase nor cook regular white rice ever again. It is pointless with its lack of fiber. Why eat it? I don't understand why this is not sold in stores, like Whole Foods. Glad to have online shopping options!<br /><br />And, I want to thank other reviewers here for their comments, as they helped me to make the decision and try this. I am converted!

review/summary: Long time, finally found!
review/text: This is one of the best tasting rice varieties I ever tried. It was available locally (central Maryland) in the past, but I had been unable to find it for quite awhile, recently ran out of it, and thought it was discontinued (boo hiss!) I never thought to look at Amazon until today, and thank heavens it is available in the Subscribe and Save program! It is still not cheap, but it is much more affordable than ordering directly from the manufacturer's site.<br /><br />I always wondered exactly what made it "light" brown rice, but after reading through the reviews my suspicions are confirmed- this is partially milled, but not totally stripped as is the case with white rice. That is fine with me- I always have lots of veggies in my rice dishes, so if some of the fiber is taken out with partial milling, I can live with it. The flavor really is better than white, and the texture is not nearly as "tough" as brown.

review/text: According to the manufacturer's website, [...], this has half the fiber of their regular brown rice. That's because half the bran has been polished off, while all the bran on white rice has been polished off. I wouldn't call this brown rice, or whole grain. I imagine that it has fewer B vitamins than real brown rice too, though the manufacturer doesn't put that on the package. (Maybe you know you're in trouble when plant seeds need a manufacturer.)

It's great for people who don't like the nuttier flavor and chewier texture of brown rice (or for those occasions when brown rice would overpower the dish you're serving with rice).

review/text: I purchased 2 of these jars for use in my garden. I plant many bulbs every Fall, but only half of the bulbs survive the onslaught of the squirrels! Faced with spending ever increasing amounts of money on more and more bulbs, I decided to fight back. I searched far and wide for a squirrel deterrent that would be organic and non-toxic for humans and pets. There was no product on the market that was not accompanied by a page of toxic warnings. I decided to try cayenne pepper after doing some online research.<br /><br />I used A LOT of this pepper, everywhere in my garden, covering all of the planting surface. I sat back and began to await the oncoming squirrel offensive. They came, but they did not linger. The first squirrel scout appeared, after gingerly tip-toeing through a promising patch of ground, she attempted a hole, but immediately left the garden to dig in the grass. I was thrilled! As time has passed, I have observed no new squirrel digging holes in my garden. I may actually see most of my prized tulips in the Spring, hooray for cayenne pepper!<br /><br />This product is the best price/quantity value that I could find, try this for your garden, it works!

The cheese sauce tastes more like real cheese than the sweet, overprocessed Kraft sauce. Once you acquire a taste for Annie's, there's no going back! On the other hand, the kids' friends who come over for lunch often turn up their noses at our Annie's mac and cheese, because they are so accustomed to Kraft or the like. I like that Annie's are all-natural, too, but it's mainly the taste that keeps me coming back for more.

review/summary: NICE & CHEESY
review/text: It was the first time I'd tried this, usually when I cook Mac from a box I mix in some extra sharp cheddar and put it under the grill. After I'd cooked it, I tasted it and it was super cheesy, it didn't need any more cheese.<br /><br />A while back I bought "Annie's Homegrown Totally Natural Shells & Real Aged Cheddar Mac & Cheese, I liked it too, but I think I like this better.<br /><br />It's so easy to make, just cook the pasta about 10 minutes. While it's draining place butter or milk (3 tbsp) into the hot pan and mix in contents of the cheese packet. At this stage it went a little lumpy. Lastly I added the drained pasta. There were still a few little lumps, but it still tasted good and was a nice consistancy.<br /><br />A nice quick, filling inexpensive meal. I ate the whole thing!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I've made this a few times now, and I'm getting better at making it, I don't have any problems with it going lumpy. I give the cheese and milk (or butter and milk) a good fast beating, that seems to do the trick.

review/summary: The best mac n cheese out there!
review/text: I love this brand of organic products and especially love the bunny theme :0 but the white cheese is great and can't be beat in its class (dried powdered cheese mix) I added a few chunks of sharp cheddar and this is the best! Add  some bread crumbs and almost won't know its from a box! And its cute!

review/summary: Mom of a SPD preschooler
review/text: He wanted more!! We recently switched to a more organic way of eating in our house to see if diet played a role in my son's sleep issues. Within 2 weeks of removing most processed foods, he's sleeping again, but finding tasty organic meals for him has been quite a challenge. This is the "best nacanoni", he says. He loved the shape (resembles Max and Ruby) and even helped cook it, as he was able to follow the recipe directions on the box. What a great product. I look forward to trying some of their other tasty pastas...

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: We were hooked on Kraft...but my toddler became sensitive to preservatives and could no longer eat the regular boxed Macaroni.  For awhile, I made my own from scratch, but wanted something I could whip up faster.  So I tried Annie's and to my surprise, the stuff is delicious!  Even my kids, who do not care for my homemade kind compared to Kraft, will lick their bowls clean (even my picky one!).  The taste, as well as the no preservatives, definitely makes this worth the extra cost.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I've tried Annie's mac & cheese several times because I keep hoping we'll like it. This was the last time I'm ever buying it. It has no taste and at the same time tastes awful, which I know makes no sense but it's true. Fake cheese covered cardboard is the closest I can get to describing it. The aftertaste is especially gross. Doesn't smell so hot either. I'm not a blue box fan, but that's at least edible at times. This one, not so much. I even tasted everything separate and checked my milk since it was a new carton...maybe that was bad? No. Tasted the plain noodle left in the strainer...that was ok. Even tasted the remnants of the powder in the paper pouch...not horrible and much like a cheese curl. So what makes it so bad when it's all mixed together? Who knows, but never again.

review/text: Maybe my expectations were too high but this seemed to have almost no flavor at all. After following the instructions and ending up with a bland outcome, I added some butter and salt. Then more salt. It got saltier, but I could taste little else. Last time I checked, 'real' cheese was supposed to have flavor. I get that it's healthier than the blue box, but I would rather just have no mac & cheese at all if this is the only alternative.

review/summary: Might be healthy, but who wants to eat it?
review/text: What's the point in trying to serve your kids healthier mac n cheese if they won't even eat it because the taste is terrible? We've tried this multiple times, but my kids don't like it (ages 2 and 4). They are always quite excited about the bunny shapes and beg for me to make it, but after a couple bites the rest just sits in their bowl. I tried it too and thought it was gross. It doesn't taste like real cheese at all (does powdered anything ever taste like the real thing?), but has that stale/flat out-of-the-box kind of taste. When I'm in a hurry, I think I will just stick with the not-as-good-for-you blue box mac n cheese (which is delicious, even if fake-tasting, haha! :) and go to the extra effort to make my own homemade mac n cheese when I have time.

And they're not rawhide, they're made in the USA, and they last (for two small dogs anyway) through a whole afternoon/evening of chewing. This is a great way to occupy two young dogs (ages 1 and 2) for hours. I guess I just wish they'd make a 50-count package!

I give her a rawhide strip or bone, she's just as likely to bury it for later use.  Evidently the Bully Springs don't need the "seasoning" other chews do.  I tend to use the Bully Springs as a distraction so she doesn't continue to jump around new guests or otherwise get over excited.  The big box of springs ordered on Amazon is about half the price - or better - than in the stores.

review/text: I got Khaos because it's not bad tasting, and the can is quite big.  Monster M-80 tastes a lot better, but is only available in 16 ounces.  16 ounces always leaves one wanting more.  The 24 ounce Khaos does not have this problem, not only because it's 50% bigger, but because the taste isn't very good and you're kind of happy to be done with it.  It's better than most energy drinks, but has the toxic synthetic/plastic/bile flavor most energy drinks have.  It is 50% fruit juice though, and has beta carotene as well as vitamins, so it's not really bad.  It's just not great tasting like the M-80.  But, 24 ounces is really a great size.  It's enough.

review/text: Everyone has different tastes, obviously, and I disagree 100% with the previous reviews that say this is terrible. Maybe for them it was, but to me and my wife, this tastes more like an orange than the obviously artificial plain "Orange" flavor Kool-Aid. It reminds me of a discontinued Gatorade flavor, Cool Citrus. I happened to like that, so that's probably why I like this so much. If you can find this in a single pack at the store, I suggest giving it a try, you might actually enjoy it. It seems lots of others like it too--while I write this review, only 3 remain in stock. This is our second-favorite flavor after Blastin Berry Cherry.

The Orange is pretty good too.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets to make it sweeter.

review/text: I used to love spaghettios, but I learned that they had corn syrup in them and I have eliminated that from my diet. So I needed a substitute for quick easy meals that taste like army food bahahaha. BernieOs taste almost exactly like spaghettios except the noodles are a bit more al dente, altho still soft. I think thats a plus. The sauce is comparable, if not tasting the same. I really have nothing to complain about except the price, but for the few times I eat it, who cares. If youre interested in this, I think its definitely worth a try.<br /><br />The bad reviews just got bad batches or damage in the mail. Just return it as damaged and get a new one. Amazon is very customer friendly in that regard. No need to leave a bad review for one incident.<br /><br />Remember to heat on the stove, not the microwave! Microwaves destroy nutrients and may create carcinogens in the food. So if you microwave it, you are defeating the purpose of eating healthy!<br /><br />Enjoy! :)

review/summary: Kid-Friendly But ...
review/text: This is definitely a kid-friendly, super-easy (open and heat) product. Easy to serve and usually welcomed with excitement by the under-7 set based on looks alone. BUT if you think these are a super-healthy option just because they are organic, you're definitely kidding yourself. Organic or not, this is still stuffed with sodium and preservatives, albeit of the more natural variety--it is, after all, canned, pre-cooked food. Better than a trip through the McDonald's drive thru? I'd say, yeah, probably, especially with a vegetable side. Healthier than just about any other non-prepackaged pasta option, organic or otherwise? Umm, not likely.<br /><br />As for taste, the reviewer who called these pasta in tomato soup just about nailed the flavor profile, though the mushy pasta wasn't pointed out (perhaps implied?). Honestly, in the one time we tried these, when my four-year-old was left with a babysitter that I don't really want to ask to cook anything, he was excited at first, but then barely ate any.<br /><br />In general, I think Annie's tends to make tasty, convenient products that are a healthier (note I didn't say "healthy") choice than similar products, but this one seems like a miss. If you must have processed convenience food on hand--and, c'mon, I do my best, but we're all human, and busy--I think there are plenty of tastier and more nutritious options out there, including other Annie's Organics products.

review/summary: well-made, great for kids
review/text: I bought these lunch trays because I was trying to move away from giving my kids so much plastic to eat off of.  I have been pleased with the trays so far.  They are pretty durable and are just the right size for my two- and five-year olds.  The trays have been dropped but haven't dented.  It seems like they will last for a long time.  My kids love the three separate compartments. The only thing I would have liked to have would be a clear marking on the bottom that states how I should wash the trays.  I've just been handwashing them because I keep forgetting to look up whether or not I can put them in the dishwasher.

review/summary: smells like cherry cough syrup, doesn't taste like it
review/text: When opening the bag, the smell was very strong of cherry cough syrup. Once brewed the smell it much lighter and not unpleasant. The flavor was ok, pleasant roobios flavor, however the cherry blossom part left something to be desired. Overall I am pretty ambivalent about this flavor and probably won't order it again. I have ordered other flavor teas from this company and enjoyed them very much. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNRJQ">Tea's Etc 1000 Cranes White Tea, 8-Ounce</a>, for example, is spectacular.

review/summary: Perhaps the best Rooibos in the US
review/text: I've imported my rooibos since I couldn't find a decent flavored kind in the US, not even at Teavana, despite their awful prices. This cherry blossom rooibos is almost as good as my imported stuff, I really enjoyed it!

review/text: I use to purchase these cereal bars in my local grocery store but they don't have them anymore. To get them I have to go way out of my way. Ordering them through Amazon is a better value and it arrives at my door in the time promised.

review/summary: Excellent, Sugar Free Cereal Bars
review/text: These are tasty! The fruit flavor is excellent. I could almost eat a box a time. Plus, best of all they're fruit juice sweetened... No sugar.

review/text: I bought these every week when I lived in Portland, now that I am in the Midwest I can't find my favorite breakfast bar. Loved getting them this way, they are fresher and even better than from the store.

review/summary: No egg, dairy, soy, peanut free facility...
review/text: I'm so glad we found these.<br /><br />My egg and peanut allergic daughter loved the organic cereal bars I was buying and it made a good quick but filling breakfast or snack for us when we're busy. But then we found out she's also allergic to Soy and slightly to cow milk. And almost everything I've found that is egg free has soy, including the bars we were using.<br />She loves these, and is happy to have her bars back.<br /><br />15 g sugar per bar... so definitely not an all the time thing

review/summary: Price increased, size decreased
review/text: I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. That's deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them.

review/summary: Great for kids
review/text: My son loves these cereal bars. I used to be able to get them at my local market for the past 5 years, until they were discontinued. My son has allergies to milk products and is unable to eat regular cereal bars and these are a great substitute. I am glad I can now continue to obtain these Amazon. We have tried other cereal bars that are diary and gluten free but they are not as tasty.

review/summary: Perfect mid morning snack!
review/text: I have been having these as a mid morning snack at work for over 7 years now. They are so delicious and with much better ingredients and less preservatives than nutra grain bars. Now my little toddler loves them too! I worried they were discontinued when Nature's Choice, the original brand, stopped carrying them. But they were just bought out by Barbara's. Same exact delicious product thankfully!

review/summary: very tasty
review/text: i love the flavor and taste of these bars.  the multigrain is made up of oats and barley, giving the crust a fresh taste and not crumbly.  the triple berries is a nice blend and there is not one overwhelming flavor between the crust and berries.  150 calories, 29g of carbs.  it is a tasty and filling bar.  highly recommended for a breakfast treat along with a good cup of coffee!
