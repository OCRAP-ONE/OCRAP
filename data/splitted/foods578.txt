Better than other junk.<br />Tastes really good. smooth, creamy, not too much sugar like other natural juices.<br />About 50c/piece when buying in retail.<br />If you can't find locally to try try thjis mango flavor first. Other flavor also seems to be good in this review at<br />[...]<br />Do not have to freeze all of them. Can freeze as we use it.

review/summary: Great alternative to traditional popsicles/ice cream treats!
review/text: I was looking for something more natural than traditional frozen treats for my kids to enjoy during the summer, and found Smooze on Amazon and had to try it.  Overall, they are pretty fantastic.  You do need to make sure you shake them REALLY well before freezing or they can get pretty icy and less creamy.  My kids (8,6 and 3) are pretty picky, so I was worried they would reject these.  They love them and we have already devoured the first 2 boxes!  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Smoooooze!
review/text: I am in love with this amazingly delicious, smooth and rich, yet amazingly low calorie/low sugar treat!  Not to mention all natural, vegan, yet decadently satisfying.  Mango is definitely my favorite of the flavors.<br /><br />I found it at the local WF a few years ago and have been hooked ever since.  It's so convenient to get in bulk from Amazon delivered right to my door, and then have them on hand when needed.  It's amazing that they have a pretty decent shelf life at room temperature, so once can freeze a box at a time (less if you want to be really good -- but hey, you only live once.)

review/text: I've been cutting sugar out of my diet for a few months now.  I've tried several different flavored syrups, and this flavor is the best so far.  It is good in coffee and cocoa and also works well in recipes like pumpkin bread and sweet potato casserole.  It has more flavor "depth" than most of the syrup flavors I've tried (vanilla, Irish cream, chocolate) and no after taste.  Definitely a keeper!

review/summary: Bait & Switch
review/text: I was trying to order Nonni's "Biscotti Dolce Ciocolati" and clicked on the iconic photo of the plastic tub of 25 individually wrapped biscotti (on the photo label on the tub is clearly printed "Dolce Cioccolati"). What I didn't notice was that the linked text to the right of the iconic photo identifies the item as "Nonni's Cioccolati Biscotti." The missing word is "Dolce" and it is an entirely different product.<br /><br />My first complaint is the "bait and switch" issue, and the other is that the product is carelessly packed so that almost all of the individually wrapped biscotti were broken, often in several pieces.<br /><br />Except for that, Nonni's Biscotti products are the best on the market, and I have tried all of them!<br /><br />Why do I suspect that Nonni's is trying to phase out the "Dolce Cioccolati" and perhaps even the plastic tubs of 25 pieces? All our local markets stock only Nonni's Biscotti in small rectangular packages in which the individual biscotti are smaller and more expensive.

There's actually only 30 lollipops in the box. That's not bad, considering they're approximately $1/pop, but I'll have to really think hard about my friendships and ask myself, "Should I really share a lolly with this this person?

These 8 oz. boxes are ideal for day-to-day use (errands, park trips, packed lunch for preschool), travel, at restaurants that do not provide milk alternatives, other people's houses, etc. I no longer have to carry a quart sized container with me or put the Rice Dream in a Thermos when we go places. They also resemble 'juice' boxes and therefore he doesn't feel like the 'odd man out' when among friends. Convenient. My son does prefer the Vanilla flavoring over the original.

review/summary: There are better tasting, healthier alternatives, e.g. Rice Dream Heartwise.
review/text: I used Rice Dream Rice beverages for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In additon, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />The Rice Dream Heartwise products are lower in sugar, use safflower and not canola oil, and contain possibly beneficial plant sterols. Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, and like the Heartwise drink is also canola free.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. Check out these peer-reviewed medical journal articles.<br /><br />Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage.

It was nearly the same as pouring plain water in my cup.  Yuck.  For 130 calories and 26 grams of carbs, this should taste much, much better!  The 8oz. boxes would have been extremely convenient, but instead I'll be donating the rest to a local shelter tomorrow then heading back to Trader Joe's to pick up some 32oz. boxes of low sugar vanilla almond milk.

review/summary: This is soooooooo GOOD!!
review/text: I prefer the Vanila but either "flavor" is great. I drink it plain or I mix my protein/fruit/calcium shake mixes in with it.<br /><br />I sometimes like to mix it with Soy milk, but I also enjoy the Rice milk by itself because it is lighter in viscosity than the Soy milk, and you can chug it.<br /><br />Either way, Rice Dream rice milk is a tasty and healthy alternative to my lactose intolerance problem.<br /><br />Rice Dream has been around for a long time -- they make delish ice creams too.<br /><br />It mixes well with certain fruit juices (but beware -- some fruit juices will curdle it), and is a good alternative to coffee cream.<br /><br />For anyone over the legal drinking age, it goes well with liquers too!!

review/summary: Great Tasting Tea
review/text: First tasted this tea about 10 years ago at a Christmas Event.  Liked it at the first sip!!  I tried to buy some from the wholesaler, Davidson's but at that time they only sold to business.  Then I thought I would go on Amazon for the heck of it and see if it was sold and was suprised to see it was.  So, I ordered the 12 boxes of 8 bags each.  I am giving a couple boxes along with gifts at Christmas time.  My husband is a tea drinker also and tasted this tea.  He likes it as much as I do.  I will have to order more next time since both of us are drinking it now.  Not only for Christmas time, but great anytime.

review/summary: Best tasting holiday tea ever!
review/text: I love this tea! It's holiday spice fragrances fill your senses even before you brew a cup. It's the best holiday tea I've ever tasted and worth the price.  Originally, I had received the tea as part of a gift basket from a friend. I loved the tea so much I searched until I found it on the Internet at Amazon.  I've given this tea out to my friends who have  also become fans.  It is delicious- you can smell the cloves,nutmeg,cinnamon and  orange peel-- but they are not overpowering. Instead they are well-blended to make this tea my greatest holiday find. Try it and you won't be disappointed.  I have mine with honey.  I'm anxious to try it as ice tea in the summer months. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SANRU2">Davidson's Tea Christmas Tea, 100-Count Tea Bags</a>

review/text: The teas themselves are very good, and great value for the price. I especially like the masala chai and the Earl Grey. However, the tins are a nightmare.

However, transfer these to different containers and they should be perfect!

review/summary: Fake?
review/text: I wonder where the shipment for these 100% organic black tea leaves come from.........<br />I ordered this about 12 days ago, and it arrived about a few days ago.<br />I don't know if anyone really knows this, but fake red tea has a weird after taste after you drink it.<br />I don't really want to go over how fake red tea is made, since this isn't a wiki or w.e., but red tea<br />should feel like your throat is clear after you drink it, but the fake mass produced version does the<br />opposite. I don't really believe any of the amazon loose tea leaf dealers actually sells the version in which they<br />don't require the truly epic method of tea creation at this price. Anyways if you are looking for real red tea leafs this<br />isn't the one your looking for probably, but for something worth only $25 I truly didn't expect the real version.<br />The Chai gave me stomachaches, which might be the herbs fault but it might just be me and the tea.<br />The Earl Gray is probably the only one that didn't have a great issue, but it might be me missing it.<br />The English Breakfast is probably the most questionable of the teas, since it has the effects of the fake red tea.<br />The Organic Lemon Black is a mix of English breakfast and a herb, which can probably coat the effects of the fake red tea.<br />Though the Lemon Black also gave me weird issues after drinking it, but wasn't as terrible as the Chai.<br />The Chai also seems to be a mix of the English Breakfast with some herb, so yea.<br />The Earl Gray is said on their paper to use the same tea leave, so I'm not sure is it really the same.<br />All 4 of the tea leaves are said by their handout to use the exact same tea leaf, so it might be a sale of fake tea.<br />I don't think anyone actually knows much about fake tea, but this is probably one of them.<br />Side note usually the real version cost well over 70 dollars, so its totally expected that something that cost only $25 isn't<br />that great.

review/text: I am the sort of mom who likes to bake my own cookies because 1) it's fun, and 2) I like to know what goes into them.  However, when that is not practical I buy these ginger snap cookies.<br /><br />I don't mind giving them to my family because they are mostly organic (70%) and they don't contain hydrogenated oils nor corn syrup.  In addition, they contain iron - from the molasses - which is  something you don't often find in a snack.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A superior product in my opinion.  The whole family loves them.  Even my extremely picky son.  The flavor is zingy with a definite bite and each cookie is only 26 calories.  One of the few store-bought treats that I have no problem handing out to the children.<br /><br />Pam T~

Snappy, even.  :)<br /><br />I'll also agree with the comment that they can be inconsistent from one bag to the next, but even when they're off, they're pretty good.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, one person's spicy is another person's bland.  For my family, they're just the right amount of hot after a few cookies.

review/text: When Whole Foods stopped stocking my favorite ginger snaps, I decided to get a 12-pack from Amazon instead of settling for the "365" brand, which had sugar as an ingredient, giving it a sandy texture in my mouth.  Mi-Del is the real deal and are great with coffee.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic dehydrated cane juice, canola oil, unsulphured molasses, ginger, baking soda, sea salt, soy lecithin (used as an emulsifier).  Product of Canada.<br /><br />Update:  I placed my order about 6-months ago and finally worked my way through the 12-pack.  They are not as fresh tasting now, of course but they still go great with my coffee and I consider them a healthy snack.  My sister thought they were too spicy but I love that ginger spice and just placed another order.

review/summary: Good cookies!
review/text: These cookies have a clean, crispy chocolate taste -- without the chemical-laced aftertaste of other commercially produced cookies. They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems. The ingredients are mostly organic and they are sweetened with dehydrated can juice, as opposed to the less-healthy commercial alternatives.<br /><br />Now, for the problem: I have never found these cookies in a market near me, and we have only purchased them through Amazon. Because these wonderful cookies are not pumped-up with weird chemical preservatives, the necessity of purchasing them in such big lots means that you are going to be eating a lot of cookies in a short period of time, or going in with a friend on sharing the case! However, given the high quality of this product, you should have no problem splitting up the order.<br /><br />Yummy and highly recommended!

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: These are my favorite ginger snaps & I was so pleased to be able to order these in bulk from Amazon.  I even got my first order from Amazon Warehouse so they were deeply discounted.  These are great with peanut butter.  Yum.  I also like to crush them up a little in my mortar & pestle & mix them into my granola.  They also make good cookie crumb pie crusts.  There are so many great uses for these including of course just eating them out of the bag.

review/summary: Crunchy Little Cookie - Delicious
review/text: My order for Mi-Del Ginger Snaps arrived a few hours ago and I tried my first one ... okay, I'm on my 10th cookie now.  My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch.  I like crunchy cookies, others may not.  I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them.  The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth.  On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle.  Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'.  It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.  Excellent product that I will purchase again.<br /><br />Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.<br /><br />--Sailor Hill, CA

review/summary: Well worth the money
review/text: I originally bought the Mi-Del cookies at a local odd-lots store over a year ago. I felt a sense of loss after the store stopped carrying them, since no other local grocer stocked them. So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS. Twelve packages may seem like a lot, but I look forward to devouring every one of them. I've also tried the vanilla and lemon snaps, and they're equally outstanding.

review/summary: My Favorite Cookie of All Time
review/text: This is the cookie that is the bain of my existence. I absolutely love it.<br /><br />They taste best when they are really fresh so if you buy this 12 pack dont wait 6 months to eat them all ... they dont have a long shelf life ... they get hard and loose flavor even if you never open the bag. This is probably because they are made with natural ingredients and dont have the preservatives found in other cookies.<br /><br />But honestly i love these cookies they are sweet, crisp and very gingery ... even my sister and brother in law who don't eat anything "healthy" or "organic" because they think it wont taste good, where impressed with the taste of these cookies.<br /><br />Now they are hooked too and buy them all the time.

review/summary: A Great Dunking Cookie
review/text: This cookie stands up very well to dunking in milk (about three dunked bites per cookie), and with mostly organic ingredients is about as guilt-free as possible in a cookie. We like a crisp ginger snap, and while the bag isn't self-sealing it seals well if you have a clip. We find the ginger level to be just right -- not overpowering, but definitely there.<br /><br />One correction to the ingredient list posted on this site -- there's no grape juice concentrate in the cookie, according to the bag I'm looking at right now and the Mi-Del website.<br /><br />Per serving size of 5 cookies: Calories 140; Total Fat 4g; Carbs 22g; Fiber 1g; Sugars 11g.

review/summary: So good people are taking them from me!
review/text: These cookies seemed to be a pretty good deal when I saw that there was a special offer on them. I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture. I dislike soft mushy cookies although if desperate...but I know that "snap" cookies are usually not soft so I took a chance and ordered a case!  I live alone so a case of cookies was, at once, both frightening and decadent---but I think I am going to have to order another case!  Everyone who tasted these asked me "so where did you find these?"  Of course, since I am the online shopper from hell, everyone figured I found some obscure website and paid a fortune. "Natural" and "Organic" are buzz words for "gonna cost ya more" but the price was great per bag. After I told my friends and family who tasted them that I ordered a case---the bags started disappearing pretty fast! I got hit with guilt---What are YOU going to do with 12 bags of cookies? (duh--eat them!) and everyone was very happy to lighten up my stash by taking a bag so I dont overeat! Dont I have the BEST friends and family??? LOL  Seriously--I was happy to hand them over! I enjoy turning people on to new finds. I gave a bag to my Parcel Post guy and my UPS guy (after all--they lug all the boxes to my apartment!) and they were happy! And there is a method to my giving-away madness (especially to the carriers)! Less dropping and throwing around of MY boxes!<br /><br />Ok--they are nice and lemoney (?) but they could even be a bit more lemon-like for me! They are made with more healthful ingredients (no trans-fat) so even though I am pigging out on cookies--I dont feel nearly as guilty! And at less than $2 a bag--I think they are a greal deal! Plus it never hurts to have extra cookies in the house because a cookie emergency can happen at any given moment!  So--order them!  I think you will be pleased!

Some of them have no ginger taste at all -- We like to call them "flour snaps!"<br /><br />Mi-Del Old-Fashion, Swedish Style Ginger Snaps have great taste, healthful ingredients, and I highly recommend dunking in some hot coffee or tea for even more of that comfort food feel!<br /><br />If you don't like them...

review/text: Mi-Del Old-Fashion "Swedish Style" Lemon Snaps are a crispy, chewy, lemony delight! If you are always in search of healthy snacks that aren't short on flavor, these are the cookies for you.<br /><br />These Lemon Snaps are made with organic unbleached wheat flour, canola oil and natural lemon flavor -- there's no artificial "lolly-pop" lemon taste here. You can just imagine squeezing the lemon into the mix, yourself.<br /><br />Five cookies have 140 calories, so it's not too much for a little something to get you through your day, or after dinner as a light dessert without the guilt.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Yum!

review/text: I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients.  I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good.  I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing.  The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter.  It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).<br /><br />Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off.  Not Recommended.
