review/summary: Good Basic Tea
review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/text: I've only done this tea as a cold brew iced tea. There is no bitterness, just a smooth, refreshing, green taste. The ginger is very strong. I love ginger, so that is no problem for me. A second brew was significantly weaker, so I will stick to one brew per batch of leaves with this one (I am able to get three quality brews from many green teas).

review/summary: weak Earl Grey
review/text: This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not.

review/summary: A lovely tea
review/text: After having some incredible green tea with ginger at a restaurant, I began my search for something similar. I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/summary: Sweet Jasmine
review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

review/summary: Quality Teas at Reasonable Prices
review/text: Stash is a decent brand of tea. We've got a number of their varieties in the house. We only use loose leaf and this doesn't have that tendency you sometimes get in loose leaf to be teeny tiny powder bits. You can actually tell that this was, at one time, a plant.<br /><br />It's got a good mild flavour that is just right near bedtime.

review/summary: Too many stems
review/text: It's not bad, as the fragrance just hits you when the bag opens. That being said, way too many stems in the product. I'm not a tea expert, but I've bought enough and I think they have more stems than the average. I do like the eco-friendly no frill packaging with the zipper though.

review/summary: Second batch inferior to first
review/text: My son drinks gallons of green tea.  We ordered one of the three-packs in the fall, and it was really good.  He was so impressed, we ordered it again. That (second) batch was disappointing - not nearly as full-flavored as the first.  I'm ordering it just one more time, hoping that the poorer quality was a fluke.

review/summary: Good tea.
review/text: This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. The tea itself is very good, but you must remember that this is Jasmine green tea... All in all I am happy with the purchase.

review/text: This is a quality tea that requires you to follow the directions.  My first attempt was by using my old method that works well with a different brand of tea.  In my opinion, when I did the job my old way the result was powerful (too strong).  After two more failed attempts I finally decided to read and follow the brief directions on the package. What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.

review/text: I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!

The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.

review/text: We had heard about Blue Buffalo from others who had cats that chronically threw up.  What we were told is that due to the chicken in many dry foods some cats are allergic to it.  We always thought it was hair balls and that was part of it.  After we tried this food he stopped throwing up regularly and with his regular brushing he doesn't throw up at all. The food is not cheap but it is worth the extra expense to have a happy cat.

She's pretty fussy about her food so I was worried she wouldn't eat this food because it's SO good & natural but she loves it and the best part is that she has lost weight while eating the food and she looks great.<br /><br />My only complaint now (which is really more of a wish) is that they don't make cat treats.

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: We also have a cat that had issues with throwing up.  We had to take  her to the vet every 6 weeks for steroid shots and even then she would throw up, but not as much.  We got rid of food with dyes, got rid of food with grains.  Through a process of elimination, we found out that she is allergic to chicken.  We were a little concerned about the turkey, since it is poultry, but it seems she handles turkey ok.  We've been using this food for at least 4 months now.  I hope they keep it chicken free.<br /><br />There are very few dry cat foods that do not use chicken, chicken eggs or chicken flavoring.  The only other dry food we found was Origen's 6 fish.  She does well with that one, too, but she doesn't like it as well.  We try to keep both on hand and alternate throughout the day.  She no longer needs those steroid shots which is great since they are not good for them, but she was losing so much weight from not being able to keep her food down.<br /><br />If you have a cat that throws up a lot, read the labels and beware of mystery ingredients, like 'natural flavorings'.<br /><br />We tried Science Diet Duck and green pea, (bought it from the vet, supposedly no chicken).  Our cat still got sick on it, but not as much.  It lists natural flavor.  I called and they said if the main protein is duck, then it would be duck flavoring, but I'm not convinced.  Why not list it as duck flavoring then?<br />We feed it to other cats, but when its gone we won't be buying it again.<br /><br />Another nice thing about the Blue Buffalo Turkey and Potato is that the kibble is smaller.  Our cat really likes it and is back to where her weight should be.

review/text: I was excited to find this at my local pet store for my cat who has allergies.  Her allergies would cause her to scratch at her head and ears until she had sores that would become infected.  I suspect she may be allergic to certain grains; she is definitely allergic to chicken.  Her allergy symptoms cleared up on this food, but it gave her such loose stools that won't even use her litter box anymore.  (She goes in our bathtub).<br /><br />I'm looking into other alternatives online.  I don't think cats need, or particularly tolerate, all of the fiber that comes from the oatmeal, vegetables, and fruits in this formula.  It sounds nice to us, but it's just not what cats have evolved to eat.

review/text: I usually feed BB Wilderness Duck and Chicken to my 9 cats (6 months to 15 years) but got this to try on one that is allergic to fish and corn. He likes it but not as well as the BB Wilderness. Good choice to try if your cat is showing signs of food allergies. I found out about his corn allergies when I tried using a corn based litter. I never feed any food that contains wheat, corn or soy products. I have been showing and breeding cats for over 50 years. High protein,low or no carb diets are the best for cats. If you've never fed a high protein diet try it for 3-4 months and see if you don't see a big difference in coat and shedding. I feed 80% dry food to 20% wet and/or raw.

review/text: Surprisingly, I got this food at a store near me because it had slightly less fat than the regular 18%.  I don't want my cat gaining too much weight.  My cat doesn't have any trouble with food variety, but she never ate the life source bits from the other Blue Buffalo I was getting so I stopped buying Blue Buffalo.  The store said I could take it back if I wasn't happy with the food since this is "limited" ingredients.  I only saw no chicken fat, no eggs or soy in the ingredients but they have LOTS of good things.  I don't care whether there is chicken fat or eggs anyway.  There are other alternatives.  I was beyond delighted to see her gobble this down the first time I put it in her plate and eat ALL life source bits for the first time.<br /><br />What else can I say?  It sure must be VERY TASTY and they have lots of other ingredients that make this food very nutritious.<br /><br />Go figure cats . . .

review/text: My calico cat, Rieley, has been scratching and chewing for quite some time so I decided to do some research to find out what could be causing all of this. I bought this food to try it and see if she would have any luck with the misery she was in. She's been on the food 2 weeks and she has stopped chewing, and the scratching has been reduced quite a bit. I would strongly recommend this food for any cat. Her coat is healthier looking. I have 3 other cats on this same diet and all of them love this food. I was really concerned about that issue with it being so expensive. But, it is well worth the cost since Rieley is not chewing and scratching nearly as often.

review/summary: "Medium" roast???
review/text: I recently purchased an 11 oz. bag of whole bean Seattle's Best Level 3 coffee.  The bag described it as a "medium" roast.  As I don't care for the usually burnt, bitter tasting darker roasts I previously tried, I thought I'd give this a try.  When I first opened the bag, I was struck by the very dark appearance of the beans and a burnt odor.  I was skeptical that I would care for this coffee at this point, but decided to try it anyway.  Unfortunately, my fears were confirmed when I actually tasted the coffee -- first black and then with sweetener and milk.  The bitter, burnt taste was very pronounced and this was at less than half the recommended brew strength, i.e., 3 level tablespoons for 8 cups.  If this is in fact "medium roast" coffee, I really don't want to know what the "dark roast" is like. I will not be buying any more Seattle's Best coffee.

review/summary: Seattles Best is the Best
review/text: I've tried several types of coffee, but this is by far my favorite. It has a very pleasant "nutty" flavor. It's incredibly smooth. Most types of coffee give me heartburn when I drink "too much". However, Seattle's best doesn't give me any heartburn whatsoever. I'm a loyal fan. I will add that I purchase mine at Wal-Mart (seems to be cheapest there), and I can find online coupons regularly for $1.50 off each bag, which helps a lot.

review/summary: Great pantry item
review/text: Well, I know I can't compete with Groovin Guy's video review, but I must say these mushrooms are very handy to have around when we want to add an earthy, meaty flavor and texture to stew, tomato sauce, frittatas, even pizza.  I have found them a bit of a challenge to rehydrate if they are not going to cook a long time.  Here is what I have ended up doing:  I pour some water over them to cover, and pop them in the microwave till the water nearly boils.  I let them soak for about five minutes, or until cool enough to handle. Then I snip off the stems with kitchen scissors and cut the larger mushrooms in half.  If they are going into something that will not cook a long time, I reheat the water and let them hydrate another half hour or so before using them.  If they are going into a stew or long cooking sauce, I add them in at this point to finish cooking.  Strain and use the broth!  It is rich and satisfying for soups and stews.

review/summary: The photo overstates the mushroom level that I actually received
review/text: The height of the dried shiitake mushrooms inside of the jar was substantially lower than the height of the dried shiitake mushrooms pictured in the photo.  This means either that:  (1)I did not receive 12oz of dried shiitake mushrooms as I should have, or (2)I did receive 12oz of dried shiitake mushrooms but the photo is fraudulent in depicting a height of dried shiitake mushrooms that is substantially higher than Amazon.com customers will actually receive.  The printed label on the outside of the jar has also changed, becoming a little less attractive than what is pictured in the photo.  The dried shiitake mushrooms inside of the jar are adequately good.  They are smaller in diameter than the dried shiitake mushrooms in most other brands.  I strongly urge Roland to install a tamper-evident seal on the top of the jar for this product.  This would help to prevent people from conveniently "taking a sample" of dried shiitake mushrooms, leaving less mushrooms for the paying customer.  I only received enough dried shiitake mushrooms to reach the 55% level in the height of Roland's jar.  Roland's photo of this product shows the dried shiitake mushrooms reaching the 85% level in the height of the jar.

I was surprised that they weren't the buttery, dreamy cookies of old. They were OK but not great. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy these again UNLESS they were bargain priced.<br /><br />They are more like a flat, rectangular, adult animal cracker. You know, every once and a while a little BLAH must fall, but not a regular thing for my tastes. I think Nabisco made them a little too heart healthy at the expense of taste.

review/text: I have been searching for a wet food that is both healthy for my 9-month-old kitty and also satisfies his picky palate. My cat really dislikes the classic pate style wet cat food, which unfortunately seems to be the style of most wet food out there. He definitely prefers the sliced (which I can't really blame him for - most pate style wet food looks gross to me too). I'm so glad I discovered that Blue Buffalo offers a sliced option! He loves both the sliced chicken and sliced turkey, so I ordered both to give him a little variety. I only wish Blue Buffalo offered a sliced beef or maybe a sliced fish option too! I would get them all.<br /><br />I love that I can recognize the ingredients that go into making this food, and if there happens to be any ingredient that I don't immediately recognize I can always check out Blue Buffalo's website for a clear explanation of what each ingredient is: [...]<br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I was in a hurry when purchasing the item and did not check my local Asian Market. I trusted Amazon since I rarely had any bad experience with Products sold by Amazon. But I have to day I am extremely disappoited this time.<br /><br />As pointed out by a previous reviewer, the seeds are quite small. They are not all black in terms of the color. I'd rather say something else (regular white sesame seeds?) are mixed in. Even after roasting, the aroma is not nearly as good as those unroasted decent black sesame seeds I had back when I was in China. Most importantly, the flavor! Those seeds are bitter and I dare say, you must put tons of sugar to barely cover the bittness. Unhealthy on one hand, and bad-tasting on the other hand.<br /><br />I went to my local Asian market yesterday and I found the sesame seeds there, black and white, are of much better qualify and a lot cheaper.<br /><br />Bottem line: Would not recommend it to anyone else. Do not waste your money. As much as I like Amazon, you just fail on this one.

So I think this is an exceptional buy.<br /><br />Black Sesame Seeds have a slightly stronger taste than regular white ones, but they really dress up a stir fry, or home-made rice crackers with alternating black and white sesame seeds, such as the recipe "Crispy Rice Crackers" on the blog, "Tess's Japanese Kitchen" (I tried to insert the web address, but Amazon stripped it out!).
